<h2>HENRIE THE SECOND,</h2>

<p class="center bigger">The Second Sonne of Geffrey Plantagenet.</p>


<p style="margin-top:3em;">
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;1.</span>
Henrie the second of that name, a French man borne, the second sonne of
Geffrey Plantagenet earle of Aniou, begotten of Maud the empresse,
daughter to Henrie the first, began his reigne ouer England the fiue and
twentith of October, in the yeare after the creation of the world 5121.
and in the yeare after the incarnation of our sauiour 1154.
<span class="yearnote">1154.</span>
 about the
beginning of the third yeare of the emperour Frederike the first, the
second of pope Anastasius the fourth, the seuenteenth yeare of Lewes the
seuenth king of France, and second of Malcolme then king of Scotland.
Immediatlie after he was aduertised of the death of king Stephan, he
came ouer into England, landing at Ostreham about the seuenth day of
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
December. After he had got his companies togither, which by tempest were
scattered in his passage, he came first to Winchester, where he receiued
homage and fealtie of the Nobles of the realme resorting vnto him. This
doone he set foorth towards London, where he was crowned king by
Theobald archbishop of Canturburie the twentith daie of December.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> The archbishop of Rouen.</span>
The archbishop of Rouen, with thr&eacute;e of his suffragans, the archbishop of
Yorke, and manie other bishops of England: Theodorus the earle of
Flanders, with a great number of other earles, lords and barons were
present there at his coronation. He was at that time about the age of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
three and twentie yeares, and to win the peoples loue, he spake manie
comfortable words vnto them, to put them in hope (as the manner is) that
they should find him a louing prince. He vsed the lords also verie
<span class="rightnote">Councellers chosen.</span>
courteouslie. And first of all, after his att&eacute;ining to the crowne, he
chose to him councellers of the grauest personages, and best learned in
the lawes of the realme, with whose prudent aduice he perused those
lawes, and amended them where he thought necessarie, commanding
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i></span>
chieflie, that the lawes established by his grandfather Henrie the first
should be obserued: and in manie things he relied vpon the aduice of
Theobald archbishop of Canturburie, at whose sute he admitted Thomas
<span class="rightnote">Thom. Becket lord chancellor</span>
Becket to be his chancellour, which Becket the said archbishop had made
archdeacon of Canturburie the yeare before.</p>

<p>Moreouer, by the sentence and doome of his councellers, to the intent
that peace and quiet order might take place, and be the better
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;2. <br />
1155</span>
mainteined, he commanded by waie of publishing a proclamation, that all
strangers (which to get somwhat by the wars had flocked into the realme,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Nic.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Polydor.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i>
Strangers appointed to depart the realme. Aliens auoid the land.</span>
during the time of the ciuill discord betweene him and king Stephan)
shuld depart home without further delaie: wherefore he appointed them a
daie, before the which they should auoid vpon perill that might insue.
It was a worlds woonder to s&eacute;e and marke how suddenlie these aliens were
quite vanished, as though they had b&eacute;ene phantasmes. Their abiding here
was nothing profitable to the subiects of the realme, as they that were
accustomed to attempt one shrewd turne vpon an others necke,
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
and
thought it lawfull for them so to doo. Amongst them was a great number
of Flemings, whom the king hated more than the residue.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">William de Ypres.</span>
By vertue also of this edict, William of Ypres, whom king Stephan (as ye
haue heard) had made earle of Kent, was constreined with others to
depart the realme, king Henrie seizing all his possessions into his owne
<span class="rightnote">Castels ouerthrowne. <i>Polydor.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
hands. Diuerse castels were throwne downe and made plaine with the
ground at the kings commandement, which priuate men by king Stephans
permission had builded, or else for that they stood not in such places
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
as was thought meet and expedient; yet some he caused to be fortified:
and furthermore, tooke into his hands againe such lands and possessions
as apperteined to the crowne, and were alienated vnto any manner of
person, of what degr&eacute;e so euer he was. This wounded the minds of many
with an inward grudge, as well enough perceiuing that the king would
looke so n&eacute;ere to his owne commoditie, that nothing should be left for
them that might any way be recouered and gotten to his vse.</p>

<p>In this yere queene Elianor being then in the citie of London, on the
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i>
William Peuerell disherited.</span>
last of Februarie was deliuered of hir second sonne named Henrie. About
the same time also, William Peuerell of Notingham a noble man and of
great possessions was disherited by the king for sorcerie and
witchcraft<a name="FNanchor_5_1" id="FNanchor_5_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, which he had practised to kill Ranulfe earle of Chester, as
it was reuealed openlie, and brought to light. In accomplishing of which
hainous crime and detestable act, many others were of counsell, and
found giltie with him, which escaped not vnpunished.</p>

<p>On the tenth of Aprill, king Henrie assembled the p&eacute;eres &amp; great lords
<span class="rightnote"><i>Nic.&nbsp;Treuet.</i></span>
of his realme togither at Wallingford, and caused them to sweare
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Nic.&nbsp;Treuet.</i>
Hugh de Mortimer. The castell of Cleberie.</span>
allegiance vnto his eldest sonne William: prouiding, that if he chanced
to die, then they should doo the like vnto his brother Henrie. Also
whereas Hugh de Mortimer had fensed his castels against king Henrie, he
besieged the same, and taking the castell of Cleberie, he destroied it.
Wherevpon, the foresaid Hugh shortlie after was at peace with the king,
and surrendred to him the two castels of Wigmore and Bridgenorth, which
<span class="rightnote">Roger Fitz Miles.</span>
hitherto he had holden. Moreouer, whereas there was variance kindled
betwixt the king, and Roger Fitz Miles of Glocester (who was earle of
Hereford) for the lands of Glocester, that variance was also quenched:
for after the same Roger was dead, his brother Walter succeeding him in
the earldome of Hereford, was constreined to depart with the citie of
Glocester, which the king held and reteined in his owne hands.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;2.</span>
In the second yeare of his reigne, king Henrie went to Yorke, and in
<span class="rightnote">The king goeth into the north.</span>
that countrie tooke into his hands diuers castels which had b&eacute;ene long
in possession of priuate men; namelie,
<span class="rightnote">The castell of Scarborough.</span>
the castell of Scarborough, which
William earle of Albemarle held, and now was constreined to resign it
vp, full sore against his will. This yeare William the kings eldest
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Nic.&nbsp;Treuet.</i>
The death of the kings son William.<br />
Geffrey the kings brother rebelleth.</span>
sonne departed this life, and was buried at Reading. The realme of
England was brought on all sides into verie good quiet; but yer long,
word came to K. Henrie, that his brother Geffrey had begun a rebellion
on the other side of the sea. For their father Geffrey (when he died)
left thr&eacute;e sonnes behind him, Henrie, Geffrey, and William, ordeining by
his testament, when Henrie should haue gotten possession of England and
Normandie, that then the countrie of Aniou should remaine vnto Geffrey,
and in the meane time, he to haue these three townes, Chinon, Lodun, and
Mirabell, to mainteine his estate; and when the time came that the whole
heritage should fall vnto him, he might by possession of these three
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
haue a readier meane to come by all the rest. Furthermore, fearing least
his eldest sonne Henrie (who as then was absent) would not consent to
the performance of this his will, he caused certeine bishops and other
of the Nobles to sweare, that they should not suffer his bodie to be
committed to buriall, till his sonnes had sworne to fulfill his last
will and testament in all other things, but especially in this behalfe,
wherin he iudged not amisse. For though Henrie was loth to take his oth,
yet bicause his fathers bodie should not remaine vnburied, he was
contented to sweare.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
But after he had obteined the kingdome of England, his couetous desire,
increasing still with abundance alreadie obteined, found meanes to
<span class="rightnote">Pope Adrian an Englishman borne. A dispensati&#333; for an oth.
<i>Nic.&nbsp;Treuet.</i></span>
procure of pope Adrian the fourth (who was an Englishman borne) a
dispensation for that oth: wherevpon (hauing got licence to depart from
the office both of right, law and equitie) neglecting his fathers
ordinance, he passed ouer into Normandie, and making war against his
brother the said Geffrey, easilie expelled him out of those places,
which were assigned him by bequest in his fathers testament, and so
tooke the earledome of Aniou into his owne possession. Howbeit, he gaue
vnto his said brother a pension of a thousand pounds English &amp; two
thousand pounds of the monie of Aniou, with the towne of Lodun, and
certeine other lands to liue vpon; who neuerthelesse thinking himselfe
euill vsed at the kings hands, rebelled and died.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Here we haue to note the lacke of conscience and religion, not onlie
in the pretended successor of Peter in giuing a dispensasion for an oth,
but also in his good ghostlie sonne, who was no lesse forward in
reuolting from his oth, than the other was willing to acquite him from
the force thereof. But if these men had beene profiting scholars in the
vniuersitie of the pagans, as they were arrand truants and ranke
dullards in the schoole of christians, they might haue learned by
profane examples, that as oths are not to be rashlie taken, so they are
not to be vnaduisedlie broken. Herevnto alludeth Aristotle in his
Metaphysikes, shewing the cause why poetrie hath feigned that the gods
in old time vsed to sweare by water, as Jupiter is reported to haue
doone in this manner;</p>

Shortlie after, when king Henrie had dispatched his businesse in
Normandie, and made an end of troubles there betwixt him and his brother
Geffrey, he returned into England, bicause he receiued aduertisement,

first into Cumberland, he tooke the citie of Carleil, seizing all that

towne of Newcastell, with the castell of Bamburg, and tooke into his
possession all that countrie which his mother the empresse had sometimes
granted vnto king Dauid, as before ye haue heard: howbeit, bicause he
would not s&eacute;eme to offer too much wrong, and be esteemed vnmindfull of

<p>After the two kings were departed in sunder, K. Henrie prepared an armie
against Conan duke of Britaine, who had seized the citie of Naunts into
his hands, after the decease of Geffrey the kings brother, who was earle

king of Aragon.</p>

<p>In the meane time, a secret grudge that had long depended betw&eacute;ene king
Henrie and king Lewes of France did still continue, and though there was
a friendship agreed betweene them (as ye haue heard) to haue
<span class="rightnote">A fained friendship.</span>
extinguished the same; yet was it but a fained friendship: for vpon
euery new occasion they were readie to breake againe, as it came to

<p>
<span class="rightnote">William duke of Aquitaine.<br />
Earle of saint Giles otherwise Tholouze.</span>
William duke of Aquitane, grandfather to queene Elianor, married the
daughter and heire of the earle of Tholouze, and going vnto the warres
of the holie land, he engaged that earledome vnto Raimond the earle of
saint Giles, and died before he could returne. His sonne William, father
to qu&eacute;ene Elianor, suffered his earledome to remaine still vnred&eacute;emed,
either for want of sufficiencie, or through negligence and carelesnesse:
so that the earle of saint Giles k&eacute;eping possession thereof vnto his
dieng daie, left it to his sonne Raimond, who inioyed it likewise. Now
when king Lewes (hauing married the foresaid Elianor) demanded
restitution as in the right of his wife, earle Raimond flatlie at the
first denied to restore it, but after considering his lacke of power to
resist the kings puissance, he plied the K. with humble petitions, and
so preuailed by faire words; that in the end king Lewes granted him his
sister Constance in marriage (which Constance, as ye haue heard, was
married before vnto Eustace the sonne of king Stephan) &amp; with hir
granted him libertie to reteine the earldome of Tholouze as it were by

in the right of his wife. Herevpon earle Raimond, trusting now to the
aid of his brother in law king Lewes, denied to restore it; so that king
Henrie determined to recouer it by force, and entring by and by into
Gascoine with an armie, he drew towards the countrie of Tholouze, &amp;
began to inuade the same with great force and courage.</p>

those quarters, hauing vnder his rule manie cities, castels and townes,
notwithstanding that he had of late lost many of them by violence of the
foresaid earle of Tholouze, but now by the aide of king Henrie he
recouered them all. Malcolme also king of Scotland came vnto king

businesse.</p>

<p>The earle hearing of king Henries comming with an armie, was put in
great feare, and therevpon wrote letters to his brother in law king
Lewes, requiring him with all sp&eacute;ed possible to come vnto his aid. King
Lewes vpon receipt of the letters, &amp; vnderstanding the present danger of
the earle, made such hast in continuing his iournie both daie and night,
that he came to Tholouze, before king Henrie could arriue there. Which
when king Henrie vnderstood, and perceiued how he was preuented, he
changed his purpose of besieging the citie, and fell to spoiling of the
countrie thereabouts: at which time he
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
recouered certaine places that

appointing his chancellor Thomas Becket to the custodie and keeping
thereof: he fortified other places also which he had gotten, placing

returned towards Normandie, and comming to the citie of Toures, he gaue
the order of knighthood vnto Malcolme king of Scotland, and so in the
moneth of October he came backe into Normandie, and there augmenting his

reason of the fire and smoke which staied and kept them from it.
Moreouer, Simon earle of Auranches deliuered vnto king Henrie such
fortresses as he held in France, as Rochfort, Montfort, and such like,
which was no small discommoditie and inconuenience to the French king,
bicause the garisons placed in those fortresses impeached the passage

About the same time came certeine Dutchmen of the sort called Ualdoies
ouer into this realme, to the number of thirtie or more, who held
opinions in religion contrarie to the faith of the Romane church, for
(as one author affirmeth) they which first spred the opinions which
these men held, came from Gascoigne, and preuailed so greatlie in
setting foorth their doctrine, that they mightilie increased through the
large regions of Spaine, France, Italie, and Germanie: simple men (God
wote) they were for the most part, as is written of them, and of no
quicke capacitie. Howbeit, those which at this time came ouer into

such grace from the same, as the church by hir authoritie had then
ascribed thereto. To conclude, they would renounce their opinions, in
somuch that they were condemned, burned in the forehead with an hot
iron, and in the cold season of winter stripped naked from the girdle
steed vpward, and so whipped out of the towne; with proclamation made,
<span class="rightnote">They are forbidden meat and drinke. They are starued to

<p>King Henrie, shortlie after the marriage was consummate betwixt his
sonne &amp; the French kings daughter, got into his hands the castell of
Gisors, with two other castels, situate vpon the riuer of Eata in the
confines of Normandie and France. For it was accorded betwixt the two
kings, that when the marriage should be finished, king Henrie should
haue those thr&eacute;e castels, bicause they apperteined to Normandie; in the
meane time, the same castels were deliuered into the hands of Robert de

Poiron, Tostes de Saint Omer, and Robert Hastings, thr&eacute;e knights
templers, who vpon the consummation of the marriages before said, and
according to the trust committed to them, surrendred the possession of
the said castels into the hands of king Henrie.</p>

<p>But the French king was not a little mooued, for that king Henrie had
seized vpon them without his licence, in so much that he raised a power
of armed men, and sent them into Normandie, where they had one cruell
conflict aboue the rest with the Normans, till the night parted them in
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gaguinus.</i> The French &amp; Normans fight.</span>
sunder, by meane whereof the Frenchmen withdrew to Chaumount, and the
Normans to Gisors. The next daie, as the Frenchmen came foorth againe,
purposing to haue won Gisors, they were beaten backe by the Normans, who
issued out of the towne to skirmish with them. Thus was the warre
<span class="rightnote"><i>Nic.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>

of Blois, the matter grew to that point, that the English and French
powers comming foorthwith into the field, and marching one against an
other, they approched so neere togither, that battell was presentlie

<p>This Becket was borne in London, his father hight Gilbert, but his

into the displeasure of manie, and namelie of the mightiest.</p>

<p>Moreouer he required of the king the k&eacute;eping of Rochester castell, &amp; the
custodie of the tower of London. He alledged also that Saltwood &amp; Hith
<span class="rightnote">The archbish. practiseth treason secretlie. Homage for the
castell of Tunbridge.</span>
belonged peculiarlie to the seigniorie of his see. He called Roger earle
of Clare vnto Westminster, to doo his homage, vnto him for the castell
of Tunbridge: but the earle denied it through the setting on of the
king, alledging all the fee thereof to apperteine rather to the king
than to the archbishop. Thus was the archbishop troubled, and he grew
dailie more and more out of the kings fauour. For yee must vnderstand,
that this was not the first nor the second, but the eight time that the
king had shewed tokens of his displeasure against him.</p>

<p>After this, vpon the first day of Julie, Rice prince of Southwales, with
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i></span>
diuerse other lords and nobles of Wales, did homage both to the king and
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;10.</span>
to his sonne Henrie at Woodstocke. Hamline the kings bastard brother
married the countesse of Warren, the widow of William earle of Mortaigne
bastard sonne to king Stephan. This countesse was the sole daughter and

<span class="yearnote">1164.</span>
heire of William the third earle of Warren, which went with Lewes king
of France into the holie land, and there died. Soone after, the Welshmen
rebelling with their prince Rice and his vncle Owen, did manie
misch&eacute;efes on the marshes: and by the death of Walter Gifford earle of
Buckingham (who deceased this yeare without heire) that earledome came
to the kings hands.</p>

<p>On the 20. daie of September were three circles seene to compasse the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
sun, and so continued the space of thr&eacute;e houres togither: which when
they vanished awaie, two sunnes appeared and sprang foorth after a
maruellous maner. Which strange sight the common people imagined to be a
signe or token of the controuersie then kindling betwixt the king and
the archbishop.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
About this time the king called a parlement at Westminster, to treat of
<span class="rightnote">Discord still kindleth betwixt the king and the archb.</span>
matters concerning the commonwealth, wherein great discord arose betwixt
the king &amp; archbishop Becket, about certeine points touching the
liberties of the church. For the king hauing an earnest zeale vnto
iustice, and commanding the iudges to punish offenders without respect,
vnderstood by their information, that manie things by them of the
spiritualtie (against whome their authoritie might not be extended) were
committed contrarie to common order: as theft, rapine, murther, and
manslaughter; in so much that in his presence it was made notorious,
that sith the beginning of his reigne, aboue an hundred manslaughters
had b&eacute;ene committed within his realme of England by pr&eacute;ests and men of
<span class="rightnote">Murthers committed by pr&eacute;ests.</span>
religious orders. Herevpon being mooued in mind, he set forth lawes
against the spiritualtie, wherein he shewed his zeale of iustice. For as
the cause proc&eacute;eded from the bishops of that age, so did the fault also,
sith contrarie to their owne canons they permitted pr&eacute;ests to liue ouer
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
licentiouslie without due correction, studieng onelie to mainteine the
liberties and immunities of the church, and not to reforme the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
irregularitie of the regulars. Of this crew was one Philip de Broc, a
canon of Bedford, who being arreigned before the kings iusticer for a
murther, vttered disdainefull words against the same iusticer: which
when he could not denie before the archbishop, he was depriued of his
prebend, and banished the land for two yeares space.</p>

<p>These things troubled the king, who therefore hauing alreadie set downe
such orders as should bridle the spiritualtie from their wicked dooings,
thought that if he might get them confirmed in parlement by consent of
the bishops and clergie, then the same should take place and be receiued
<span class="rightnote">The king meaneth to bridle the spiritualtie fr&#333;
presumptuous dealing. The prelats against the king. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
for lawes. Wherefore he earnestlie required at this parlement that it
might be enacted against all such of the spiritualtie, as should be
taken and conuicted for any henious offense, they should loose the
priuiledge of the church, and be deliuered vnto the ciuill magistrate,
who should s&eacute;e them suffer execution for their offences, in like maner
as he might any of the kings subiects being laie men. For otherwise the
king alledged, that they would boldlie presume to doo much more
mischiefe, if after ecclesiasticall discipline, no secular correction
should follow. And likelie it was that they would passe but little for
their disgrading and losse of their order, who in contempt of their
calling would not absteine from committing most mischieuous
abhominations and hainous enormities.</p>

<p>Unto these reasons thus proponed by the king (to haue his purpose take
effect) the archbishop and his suffragans, with the rest of the bishops,
answered verie pithilie, labouring to proue that it was more against the
liberties of the church, than that they might with reason well allow.
Wherevpon the king being moued exceedinglie against them, demanded
whether they would obserue his roiall lawes and customes, which the
archbishops and bishops in the time of his grandfather did hold and
<span class="rightnote">Their order saued.</span>
obeie or not? Wherevpon they made answere, that they would obserue them,
Saluo ordine suo, Their order in all things saued. But the king being
highlie offended with such exceptions, vrged the matter so, that he
would haue them to take their oth absolutely, &amp; without all exceptions,
<span class="rightnote">The king offended with the bishops.</span>
but they would none of that. At length he departed from London in verie
great displeasure with the bishops, hauing first taken from the
archbishop Thomas all the offices and dignities which he enioied since
his first being created chancellor.</p>

<p>Howbeit, after this, manie of the bishops s&eacute;eing wherevnto this broile
would grow, began to shrinke from the archbishop, and inclined to the
king. But the archbishop stood stiflie in his opinion, and would not
bend at all, till at length not onelie his suffragans the bishops, but
also the bishop of Liseux (who came ouer to doo some good in the matter)
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
and the abbat of Elemosina (who was sent from the pope) persuaded him to
agree to the kings will, in so much that being ouercome at last with the
earnest suit of his freends, he came first to Woodstocke, and there
promised the king to obserue his lawes, Bona fide, Faithfullie, and
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
without all collusion or deceit.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1164.</span>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> A councell at Clarendon.</span>
Shortlie after, in the feast of S. Hilarie, a councell was holden at
Clarendon, whereto the archbishop, and in manner all the lords
spirituall and temporall of the land made
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
their repaire. Here the
archbishop would haue willinglie started from his promise, if first the
bishops, and after the earles of Leicester and Cornewall, Robert and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
Reignald (which Reignald was vncle to the king) and lastlie two knights
templers, had not mooued him to y&eacute;eld to the kings will. But (amongst
the rest) these two knights, namelie Richard de Hastings, and Hosteus de
Boloigne were verie earnest with him, &amp; at length preuailed, though not
for conscience of dutie, wherewith he should haue beene touched; yet
with feare of danger, which (by refusing to satisfie the kings will) he
should haue brought not onelie vpon himselfe, but also vpon the other
bishops there present.</p>

<p>These knights s&eacute;emed to lament his case, as if alreadie they had s&eacute;ene
naked swords shaken about his eares. And indeed, certeine of the kings
seruants that attended vpon his person after the manner of a gard, went
to and fro, rushing vp and downe the chambers, shaking their bright
battell axes readie appointed, and looking as if they would forthwith
run vpon the bishops. Wherevpon the archbishop being touched with
remorse, and s&eacute;eming to striue against his determinat purpose, consented
to obey the kings pleasure, and so promised in the word of a pr&eacute;est,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i> The archbishop Becket receiueth an oth.</span>
swering furthermore, that he would obserue the kings lawes and customes,
without expressing these words, Saluo ordine meo, Mine order saued,
which he had vsed before. The like oth did all the bishops take. But the
archbishop refused at that time to seale to the writing that conteined
the articles of the oth which he should haue obserued, requiring as it
were a time to consider of them, sith in so weightie a matter nothing
ought to be doone without good and deliberate aduice, wherefore he tooke
with him a copie thereof, and so did the archbishop of Yorke an other,
and the third remained with the king.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">He repenteth him in that he had receiued an oth.
<i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
Shortlie after, the archbishop considering further of this oth which he
had taken, repented himselfe greeuouslie therof, in so much that he
absteined from saieng of masse, till he had by confession and fruits of
penance (as saith Matth. Paris) obteined absolution of the pope. For
addressing and sending out messengers with all sp&eacute;ed vnto the pope, with
a certificat of the whole matter as it laie, he required to be assoiled
of the bond which he had vnaduisedlie entred into. This suit was soone
granted, in so much that the pope directed his especiall letters vnto
him, conteining the same absolution in verie ample and large manner, as
Matth. Paris dooth report. And thus began a new broile.</p>

<p>The archbishop in the meane time, perceiuing that the liberties of the
church were now not onelie embezelled, but in maner extinguished, and
being loth to make any further attempt against his former dealings,
would now (without the kings knowledge) haue departed the realme,
wherevpon comming to Romnie, he tooke shipping, to haue passed ouer into
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop Becket would haue fled out of the realme.</span>
France, and so to haue gone to the popes court. But by a contrarie wind
he was brought backe into England, and thereby fell further into the
kings displeasure than before, in so much that, whereas an action was
commensed against him of late for a manor, which the archbishops of
Canturburie had of long time held: now the matter was so vsed that the
archbishop lost the manor, and was moreouer condemned to paie the
arrerages, and thus his troubles increased euen through his owne
malapertnesse and brainesicknesse; whereas all these tumults might haue
b&eacute;ene composed and laid asl&eacute;epe, if he had b&eacute;ene wise, peaceable,
patient, and obedient. For,</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop to appeare at Northampton. <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
In the end, the archbishop was cited to appeere before the king at
Northampton, where the king vsed him somewhat roughlie, placing his
horsses at his Inne, and laid disobedience to his charge, for that he
did not personallie appeare at a certeine place before his highnesse,
vpon summons giuen vnto him<a name="FNanchor_5_2" id="FNanchor_5_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for the same purpose. Wherevnto though the
archbishop alledged that he had sent thither a sufficient deputie to
<span class="rightnote">Sentence giuen against the archbishop.</span>
make
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
answere for him; yet could he not be so excused, but was found
giltie, and his goods confiscat to the kings pleasure.</p>

<p>Now when the archbishop heard that sentence was in suchwise pronounced
against him; "What maner of iudgement (saith he) is this? Though I hold
my peace, yet the age that shall hereafter follow, will not hide it in
silence; for sithens the world began, it hath not beene heard, that any
archbishop of Canturburie hath b&eacute;ene iudged in any of the king of
Englands courts for any maner of cause; partlie in regard of the
dignitie and authoritie of his office, and partlie bicause he is
spirituallie the father of the king and all his people. This is
therefore a new forme and order of iudgement, that the archbishop should
be iudged by his suffragans, or the father by his sons."</p>

<p>The next daie the king required of him the repaiment of fiue hundred
marks, which he had lent him when he was chancellor. Now although he
<span class="rightnote">The archbish. condemned in fiue hundred marks.</span>
affirmed that he receiued the same by waie of gift, and not by waie of
lone; yet bicause he confessed receit, he was condemned in that debt,
forsomuch as he could not prooue the title the gift.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">An assemblie of bishops.</span>
On the morrow after, the archbishop with his felow bishops being set in
councell, by commandement of the king (&amp; the doores fast locked that
they should not get out) this was proponed against the archbishop, that
whereas he held certeine bishops s&eacute;es as then vacant, with abbeies, and
other reuenues of his souereigne lord the king in his hands, and had
made none account to him for the same of long time; the king required
<span class="rightnote">The archbish. called to an account.</span>
now to be answered at his hands, and that with all sp&eacute;ed, for he would
haue no delaie. The summe amounted to thirtie thousand markes.</p>

<p>When the archbishop had heard the variable sentences of the bishops in
this case, he answered after this maner: "I would (said he) speake with
two earles which are about the king," and named them. Who being called,
and the doores set open, he said vnto them; "We haue not h&eacute;ere at this
present to shew whereby the thing may be more manifest: therefore we
aske respit for answer till to morrow." The councell therefore brake vp,
and the multitude of people, which came with the archbishop thither,
being afraid of the kings displeasure, fell from him. Wherefore he
caused his seruants to fetch a great number of poore and impotent people
to his lodging, saieng that by the seruice of such men of warre, a more
sp&eacute;edie victorie in short space might be gotten, than by them which in
time of temptation shamefullie drew backe. Herevpon his house was filled
full, and the tables set with such as his seruants had brought in, out
of the lanes and streats abroad.</p>

<p>Upon the tuesdaie, the bishops all amazed and full of care, came vnto
<span class="rightnote">The bishops persuade the archbishop to submit himself to the
kings pleasure.</span>
him; and bicause of the displeasure which the king had conceiued against
him, counselled him to submit himselfe to the kings will, or else in
fine, they told him plainelie, that he would be iudged a periured
person; bicause he had sworne vnto the king as to his earthlie
souereigne, touching all temporall honor in life, lim, and member; and
namelie to obserue all his roiall lawes and customes, which of late he
had established.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The archbish. answer to his brethren.</span>
Wherevnto he answered: "My brethren, ye see how the world roreth against
me, and the enimie riseth vp, but I more lament that the sonnes of my
mother fight against me. If I should hold my peace, yet would the world
come to declare how ye leaue me alone in the battell, and haue iudged
against me now these two daies past, I being your father, though neuer
so much a sinner. But I command you by virtue of your obedience, and
vpon perill of your order, that you be not present in any place of
iudgement, where my person may fortune to be adiudged: in testimonie
<span class="rightnote">He appealeth to the church of Rome.</span>
whereof I appeale to our mother the church of Rome. Furthermore, if it
chance that temporall men laie their hands vpon me, I charge you
likewise by vertue of your obedience, that ye exercise the censures of
the church in the behalfe of your father the archbishop as it becommeth
you. This one thing know ye well, that the world roreth, the flesh
trembleth
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
and is weake, but I (by Gods grace) will not shrinke, nor
leaue the flocke committed vnto me."</p>

<p>After this he entred into the church, and celebrated the masse of saint
Stephan (otherwise than he was accustomed to doo) with his pall: which
<span class="rightnote">He goeth to the court.</span>
being ended, he put on his sacrificing vestures, with a cope vpon them
all, and so went to the court. Furthermore, bicause he was afraid, he
receiued the sacrament secretlie with him, and bearing the crosse in his
right hand, and the reine of his bridell in his left, he came in that
order to the court, where he alighted, and entred the place, still
bearing the crosse himselfe, till he came to the kings chamber doore,
the other bishops following him with great feare and trembling. Now
being come thither, the bishop of Hereford would gladlie haue taken the
crosse, and haue borne it before him, but he would not suffer him,
saieng: "It is most reason that I should beare it my selfe, vnder the
defense whereof I may remaine in safetie: and beholding this ensigne, I
n&eacute;ed not doubt vnder that prince I serue."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">He is reputed a traitour.</span>
At length, when the king had exhibited great complaints vnto them all
generallie against him, they cried that he was a traitor, sith he had
receiued so manie benefits at the kings hands, and now refused to doo
him all earthlie honor as he had sworne to doo. To be short, when the
bishops came to sit vpon the matter in councell, they appealed to the
s&eacute;e of Rome against the archbishop, accusing him of periurie: and in the
word of truth bound themselues by promise, to doo what they might to
depose him, if they king would pardon them of that iudgement which now
hanged ouer the archbishops head. Then comming to the archbishop they
said: "Thou wast sometime our archbishop, and we were bound to obeie
th&eacute;e: but sith thou hast sworne fealtie to the king, that is, life
member, and earthlie honor, &amp; to obserue his lawes and customes, and now
<span class="rightnote">The bishops disallow their archbishop.</span>
goest about to destroie the same, we say that thou art guiltie of
periurie, and we will not from hencefoorth obey a periured archbishop.
Therefore we cite th&eacute;e by appelation to appeare before the pope, there
to answer thine accusors." Then they, appointed him a day, in which they
ment to prosecute their appeale. "I heare you well" (said the
archbishop).</p>

<p>The princes and p&eacute;eres of the realme did also iudge him a periured
person and a traitour. Among whome (manie then being present) the earle
of Leicester accompanied with Reignald earle of Cornewall, came vnto him
and said; "The king commanded th&eacute;e to come and render an accompt of that
which is obiected against th&eacute;e, or else heare thy iudgement."
"Judgement?" said the archbishop, [and wherewith rising vp said,] "Naie
sonne earle, first heare thou: It is not vnknowne to th&eacute;e how faithfull
I haue b&eacute;ene to the king, in consideration whereof he aduanced me to the
archbishops see against my will (as God can be my iudge:) for I knew
mine owne infirmitie, and I was contented to take it vpon me rather for
his pleasure, than for Gods cause, and therefore dooth God both withdraw
himselfe and the king from me. In the time of mine election he made me
fr&eacute;e, and discharged me of all courtlie bondage. Wherefore as touching
those things from which I am fr&eacute;e and deliuered, I am not bound to
answer, neither will I. So much as the soule is more worth than the
bodie, so much the more art thou bound to obeie God and me, rather than
any earthlie creature. Neither will law nor reason permit, that the
sonnes should iudge or condemne the father: and therefore I refuse to
stand to the iudgement either of the king, or of any other, and appeale
to the pope, by whome (vnder God) I ought to be iudged, referring all
that I haue vnto Gods protection and his, and vnder the defense of his
authoritie I depart out of this place." Hauing thus spoken, went
incontinent to take horsse.</p>

<p>Now as he passed on his waie, the kings seruants and others of the court
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> The stout courage of the archbishop.</span>
did cast out manie reprochfull words against him, calling him traitor
and false forsworne caitife. At which words turning himselfe, and
looking backe with a sterne countenance he said; "That if it were not
for his order of priesthood, and that it were lawfull for him, he
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
would
surelie cl&eacute;ere himselfe of periurie and treason, in defending and
mainteining his cause against them with weapon in hand."</p>

<p>When he was come to the vtter gate, he found the same fast locked,
whereat they began all to be amazed: but one of his seruants espieng
where a bunch of keies tied to a clubs and were hanging on a pin, he
tooke them down, &amp; tried which was the right key, by proof whereof he
found it at the last, opened the gate, and let the archbishop out, the
porters standing still as men amazed, and speaking not one word against
it.</p>

<p>Now when he was got out, a great number of poore, weake and impotent
people met him, saieng: "Blessed be God, which hath deliuered his
seruant from the face of his enimie." Thus with a great rout or
companie, and with the clergie, he was honorablie conueied to the abbie
of S. Andrews: and looking behind and before him, as he passed
thitherward, he said vnto those that went with him; "How glorious a
procession dooth bring me from the face of the enimie? Suffer all the
poore people to come into the place, that we may make merie togither in
the Lord." Hauing thus spoken the people had entrance, so that all the
hall, parlours, and chambers being furnished with tables and stooles,
they were conuenientlie placed, and serued with vittels to the full.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The archbishop Becket fled awaie in the night.</span>
The verie same night before the cockcrowing he issued foorth by a little
posterne gate, and taking with him onelie two moonks of the Cisteaux
order, the one named Robert Canne, and the other S. Cayman, with one of
his owne seruants called Roger de Broc, he fled awaie disguised in a
white vesture and a moonks coule, and changing his name, caused himselfe
to be called Dereman, &amp; iourneied still all the night, and by daie laie
close in one fr&eacute;ends house or other; till at last he got to Sandwich,
and there taking ship, he sailed ouer into Flanders, and so went to
France, where at the citie of Sens he found pope Alexander, into whose
bosome he emptied whole cart lodes of complaints and greeuances.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Gilbert Follioth bishop of London was sent to the French king.</span>
The king vpon knowledge that the archbishop was fled the realme, sent
Gilbert Follioth bishop of London, and William earle of Arundell in
sp&eacute;edie ambassage to, the king of France, to signifie vnto him the whole
matter and circumstance of the falling out betwixt him and the
archbishop, requiring him not to receiue the archbishop into his realme,
but this request was little regarded of the French king, as appeared:
for the archbishops cause was fauoured of manie, and the blame imputed
to king Henrie, so that the archbishop found great grace with the French
king, and no small fauour at the hands of the pope.</p>

<p>Now when king Henrie heard that he was accused by the archbishop vnto
<span class="rightnote">Additions to <i>Iohn&nbsp;Pike.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
the pope, he appointed Roger archbishop of Yorke, the aforesaid Gilbert
bishop of London, Hilarius bishop of Chichester, Roger bishop of
Worcester, Bartholomew bishop of Excester, with diuerse bishops, deanes,
archdeacons, &amp; other learned men of good accompt to the number of 15. to
passe in ambassage vnto the pope, that they might excuse his dooings,
and burden the archbishop with the note of rebellion, whereof he had
good proofe.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Roger archbishop of Yorke with others are sent to the pope.</span>
Being admitted to declare their message in the consistorie before the
pope, they opened the whole circumstance of the matter, from the
beginning to the end, declaring that betwixt Thomas the archbishop of
Canturburie and the king there was a controuersie moued, and by both
their consents a daie appointed for the hearing and determining thereof,
as iustice should require. At the which daie (by the kings commandement)
all the ch&eacute;efest lords of the realme both spirituall and temporall were
assembled, to the end that the more generall the m&eacute;eting should be, the
more manifest might the discouerie of the fraud and malice of the
archbishop app&eacute;ere.</p>

<p>"At the daie appointed (saie they) there came before the catholike
prince his presence, the Nobles of his realme: and amongst other, the
archbishop the disquieter both of the kingdome &amp; church, who (as one not
well assured of the qualitie of his owne deseruings) blessed himselfe
with the signe of the crosse at his comming into the court, as
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
though
he should haue come before some tyrant or schismaticall person.
Notwithstanding all which contemptuous and ambitious behauiour, the
kings maiestie was nothing offended, but committed the iudgement of his
cause to the faithfull order of the bishops, meaning so to deliuer
himselfe of all suspicion of wrong dealing. Then it rested in the
bishops hands to make an end of the controuersie, and to set a finall
vnion and agr&eacute;ement betwixt them. But the archbishop would none of that,
alleging how it should be a derogation to the s&eacute;e apostolike and his
metropoliticall dignitie, to stand before the king in iudgement, or anie
other temporall magistrate. And albeit (saie they) some diminution or
eclipse might haue chanced to the dignitie of the church by that

the time, to the end that peace might haue b&eacute;ene restored to the church.
He further obiected (ascribing to himselfe the name of father, which
seemed to sauour somewhat of arrogancie) that the children ought not to
come togither to iudge the fathers cause, but it had b&eacute;ene far more
necessarie that the humblenesse of the sons should mitigate the pride
and temper the ambition of the father."</p>

<p>To conclude the kings ambassadors made earnest suit, that two legats
<span class="rightnote">The kings tale could not be heard.</span>
might be sent from the pope, to haue the hearing &amp; discussing of all the
matter betwixt the king and the archbishop without any other appealing.
But the kings tale could not be heard in that court, the archbishop
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop Becket.</span>
hauing alreadie persuaded the pope to the contrarie. For comming to the
pope he vttered his complaint as followeth:</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
"Most holie father, I doo here come for succour to your audience,
lamenting that the state of the church, and the liberties thereof are
brought to ruine by the couetous dealing of kings and princes. Wherefore
when I thought to resist the disease approching, I was suddenlie called
before the king, to render accompts as a laie man about certeine wards,
for whom (while I was the kings chancellor) I had notwithstanding giuen
accounts; and also, when I was made bishop, and entred into the dignitie
of ruling the archbishops s&eacute;e, I was released and discharged of all
reckonings and bonds by the kings eldest sonne, and by the cheefe
iusticer of the realme: so that now, where I looked to haue found aid, I
was destitute thereof, to my great hinderance and vexation. Consider
furthermore (I praie you) how my lords and brethren the bishops are
readie at the pleasure of the Noble men of the court to giue sentence
against me, so that all men being about to run vpon me, I was almost
oppressed: and therfore am now come as it were to take breath in the
audience of your clemencie, which dooth not forsake your children in
their extreme necessitie, before whom I here stand, readie to declare
and testifie that I am not to be iudged there, nor yet at all by them.
For what other thing should that be, but to plucke awaie the right of
the church? What else then to submit spirituall things to temporall?
This example therefore once sproong vp, might giue an occasion to manie
enormities to follow. The bishops doo say, 'Those things that are
Cesars, ought to be restored to Cesar.' But admit that in manie things
the king is to be obeied, is he therefore to be obeied in things wherein
he is no king? For those belong not to Cesar, but to a tyrant. Wherein
if for my sake they would not, yet ought the bishops for their owne
sakes to haue resisted him. For what should be the cause of such deadlie
and vnnaturall hatred, that to destroie me, they should destroie
themselues? Therefore whilest for temporall things they neglect
spirituall, they faile in both. Weigh then most holie father, my fleeing
awaie, and my persecution, and how for your sake I haue beene prouoked
with iniuries, vse your rigour, constraine them to amendement, through
whose motion this hath chanced; let them not be borne out by the king,
who is rather the obstinate minister, than the finder out of this
practise."</p>

<p>The pope hauing heard his words, tooke deliberation in the matter, with
the aduice of his cardinals, and therevpon answered the archbishop in
<span class="rightnote">The popes answer to the archbishop.</span>
effect as followeth: "That the lower power may not iudge the higher, and
ch&eacute;efelie him whome he is bound to obeie, all the lawes both of God and
man doo witnesse, and the ordinances of the ancient
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
fathers doo
manifestlie declare: Herevpon we (to whome it apperteineth to reforme
disorders) doo clearelie reuerse and make void the iudgement pronounced
against you by the barons and bishops, whereby as well against the order
of law, as against the customes of the church, your goods were adiudged
forfeit, whereas the same goods were not yours, but the churches of
Canturburie, ouer which you haue the onelie cure and charge. But if
those that haue violentlie entred vpon the possessions and goods of your
church, and haue thereby wronged either you or yours, will not vpon
admonition giuen to them, make restitution with sufficient amends, then
may you (if you shall thinke conuenient) exercise ecclesiasticall
iustice vpon them, and we shall allow of that which you shall
reasonablie doo in that behalfe. Howbeit as touching the king himselfe
we will not giue you any speciall commandement, neither yet doo we take
from you any right belonging to your bishoprike office, which you
receiued at your consecration. But the king onelie we will spare, and
exempt from your excommunications and censures." After these and many
<span class="rightnote">The archbish. resigneth his pall.</span>
by-matters were ouerpassed, the archbishop resigned his pall vnto the
pope, but the pope gaue it him againe, and appointed him to remaine at
Pountney an abbeie of moonks Cisteaux in the diocesse of Auxerre, till
the variance were brought to some good end betwixt the king and him.
This was doone in the yeare of our Lord 1164.</p>

<p>The king hauing knowledge by his ambassadors what answer the pope had
made, became gr&eacute;euouslie offended in his mind, and therevpon confiscated
all the goods that belonged to the archbishop and his complices, and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
seized their reuenues into his hands, appointing one Randall de Broc to
haue the custodie of all that belonged to the see, which Broc was
nothing fr&eacute;endlie to the archbishop, being his knowne enimie of old, but
fauoured the moonkes, and would not suffer that they should take wrong
or displeasure at any hand.</p>

In the yeare 1165. queene Elianor was deliuered of a daughter which was
named Joane. Also on the 26. daie of Januarie, there chanced a
maruellous earthquake in Northfolke, in the Ile of Elie, and in
Suffolke, so that men as they stood on the ground were ouerthrowne
therewith, and buildings so shaken, that the belles in st&eacute;eples knolled:

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The Welshmen make war on the English marshes.<br />
<i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i>
<i>Polydor.</i><br />
The king inuadeth Wales.</span>
The Welshmen this yeare spoiled a great part of those countries that
bordered vpon them: wherewith the king being sore mooued, leuied an
armie with all sp&eacute;ed as well of Englishmen as strangers, and (without
regard of difficulties and dangers) did go against the rebels, and
finding them withdrawne into their starting holes (I meane the woods and
strait passages) he compassed the same about in verie forceable maner.
The Welshmen perceiuing themselues now to be brought into such
ieopardie, as that they could not well deuise how to escape the same,
consulted what was best to be doone. After consultation, casting awaie
their weapons, they came foorth to the king, asking mercie; which
somewhat hardlie they obteined. Few of them were executed in comparison
of the numbers that offended: but yet the capteines and ch&eacute;efe authors
of this rebellion were so punished, that it was thought they would neuer
haue presumed so rashlie to offend him in like sort againe. For (as some
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The seuere punishment vsed by king Henry
against the Welshmen.</span>
writers affirme) he did iustice on the sonnes of Rice or Rees, &amp; also on
the sonnes and daughters of other noble men that were his complices
verie rigorouslie: causing the eies of the yoong striplings to be pecked
out of their heads, and their noses to be cut off or slit: and the eares
of the yoong gentlewomen to be stuffed.</p>

<p>But yet I find in other authors, that in this iournie king Henrie did
not greatlie preuaile against his enimies, but rather lost manie of his
men of warre, both horssemen and footmen: for by his seuere proceeding
against them, he rather made them more eger to s&eacute;eke reuenge, than

arrow coming had not thrust himselfe betwixt
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" ></a>

the king and the same
arrow, and so preseruing his maister, receiued the stripe himselfe,
whereof he died presentlie after, bes&eacute;eching the king to be good lord to
one onelie daughter which he had, whome the king bestowed in mariage
<span class="rightnote">William de Langual&eacute;e.</span>
vpon William de Langual&eacute;e, togither with hir fathers inheritance, which
William begat of hir a sonne that bare both his name and surname. &para;&nbsp;A

surelie the king could doo no lesse, than some way requite the venturous
courage and hartie zeale of the gentleman, who with the losse of his
owne life preserued the king, if not from death, yet from some dangerous
wound that might haue put him to extreame anguish and paine. This may
incite men to be mindfull of benefits receiued, a virtue no lesse rare

But to conclude with this iourneie which king Henrie made at this time
against the Welshmen, although by reason of the cumbersome difficulties
of the places, he could not enter within the countrie so farre as he
wished, yet he so impounded and constreined them to k&eacute;epe within the
woods and mountains, that they durst not come abroad, insomuch that at
the length they were glad to sue for peace.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">William king of Scots doth his homage to king Henrie.</span>
William king of Scots, successor of Malcolme (who departed this life in
the yeare last past) after he had receiued the crowne of Scotland, came
about this present time into England, and finding king Henrie at London,
did his homage to him as his predecessour Malcolme had doone before. He
made suit also to haue Northumberland restored vnto him, which the king
of Englands mother the empresse had in times past giuen vnto king Dauid.
But king Henrie gaue diuerse reasons to excuse himselfe whie he might
not deliuer that countrie to him at that present, namelie, without
consent of a parlement: wherevpon king William perceiuing how the matter
went, gaue ouer his suit for that present, meaning (when occasion
serued) to attempt the getting thereof by force, sith that by praier and
suit he sawe well inough he should not obteine it.</p>

<p>Moreouer, the Scotish king being required by king Henrie to go ouer with
him into Normandie, granted so to doo: insomuch that king Henrie, hauing
set all things in order within his realme of England, in the Lent
following passed ouer into Normandie. But before he tooke his iourneie,
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
he set foorth a decree consisting of these points in effect as

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">An edict against the archbishop Becket.</span>
1 That no man should bring any letters or commandement from pope
Alexander, or Thomas archbishop of Canturburie into England, conteining
an interdiction of the realme: vpon perill to be apprehended and
punished as a traitour to the king, and an enimie to the realme.</p>

<p>2 That no religious person or pr&eacute;est should be permitted to passe the
seas, or to come into the relme of England, except he had letters of
safe conduct from the iusticers for passage ouer, and of the king for
his returne from thence.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Appeales forbidden.</span>
3 That no man should appeale to the said pope or archbishop, nor by

contrarie herevnto, he should be taken and committed to prison.</p>

<p>4 That if any maner of person, either spirituall or temporall, were
obedient to the sentence of the interdiction, the same person should be
banished the realme without delaie, and all his linage with him, so as
they should not conueie with them any of their goods, the which togither
with their possessions should be seized into the kings hands.</p>

<p>5 That all spirituall persons, which had any benefices within England,
should haue warning giuen to returne into England within foure moneths
after the same summons pronounced, and that if they failed hereof, then
should the king seize vpon their goods and possessions.</p>

6 That the bishops of London and Norwich, should be (and by vertue
hereof were) summoned to appeare before the kings iusticers, to make
answer for that they had interdicted the lands of erle Hugh, and
excommunicated him.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The kings of England and France enteruiew. <i>Cro.&nbsp;Sigeb.</i>

matters.</p>

<p>
This yeare the qu&eacute;ene was deliuered of a sonne named John, who afterward
was king of this realme.
<span class="rightnote">King John borne.</span>
</p>

<p>Moreouer, king Henrie calling a councell of his bishops and barons in
Normandie, caused and ordeined a collection
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> A contribution.</span>
(by their aduise) to be made
through all his countries and dominions of two pence in the pound of
euerie mans lands and goods, iewels and apparell onelie excepted: to be
paid this yeare 1166. and for the space of foure yeares next ensuing,
one penie of euerie pound to be paid yearelie: and those that were not
worth twentie shillings in goods or lands (being housholders
notwithstanding) or bare any office, should paie a penie to this
contribution, which was onelie granted for the releefe of the christians
in the east parts, and those that warred against the miscreants there.
The paiment thereof was appointed to be made in the feast daie of saint
Remigius, or within fift&eacute;ene daies after. It was also ordeined, that all
such as departed this life, within the terme that this collection was in
force (their debts being paid) should giue the tenth part of the residue
of all their goods vnto this so necessarie a contribution.</p>

<p>King Henrie remaining now in Normandie, and vnderstanding that diuerse
lords and barons of Maine, and the marshes of Britaine, would not in his
absence shew themselues obedient vnto his wife qu&eacute;ene Elianor, but were

Soone after the archbishop of Canturburie came from Pountney to Uizeley,
and there (on Ascension daie) when the church was most full of people,
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop Becket accursed those in England that
mainteined the customs of their elders.</span>
got him into the pulpit, and with booke, bell, and candell solemnelie
accurssed all the obseruers, defenders, and mainteiners, with the
promoters of such customs, as within the realme of England they terme
the custome of their elders: amongst others that were accursed, was
Richard de Lucie, Richard the archdeacon of Poictiers, Jocelin de
Bailleuille, Alane de Neuille, and manie other. But they being absent, &amp;
neither called nor conuinced (as they alleged notwithstanding they were
thus excommunicated) sent their messengers vnto the archbishop, and
appealed from him, and so feared not to enter into their churches.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houe.</i></span>
He had before this also written certeine letters vnto his suffragans,
denouncing some of these and other persons by expresse name accursed,
not onelie for mainteining the matter against him, touching the ancient
custome of the realme: but also for the schisme raised in Almaine by
Reignald archbishop of Colein, for the which he accursed one John of
Oxford. Moreouer, he accursed Ranulfe de Broc, Hugh de S. Clere, &amp;
Thomas Fitz Bernard, for violentlie seizing vpon and deteining the goods
and possessions belonging to his archbishoprike, without his consent or
agr&eacute;ement therevnto.</p>

<p>The king on the other part banished out of England, and all parts of his
other dominions, all those persons that were knowen to be of kin vnto
the archbishop, both yoong and old: and furthermore sent aduertisement
to the abbat of Pountney and to his moonks, with whom the archbishop by
the popes appointment remained, that if they kept him stil in their
house, he would not faile to banish all the moonks of their order out of
England. Now the archbishop, after he had remained there scarse two
yeares, departed from thence of his owne accord, and came to the king of
France, who courteouslie receiued him, and sent him to the abbeie of
saint Columbes neere to the citie of Sens, where he remained a certeine
season, as shall be shewed hereafter.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i><br />

Shortlie after this, two legats named William of Pauia, and John of

archbishop suspected rather to fauour the kings cause than his: yet he
was contented that they should haue the iudgment thereof committed vnto
them: so that first (according to the rules of the church) restitution
might be made both to him and his, of such goods as had beene taken from
them. For being spoiled, as he was, he would not stand to any iudgement,
nor could not be compelled thervnto by any reason (as he said.) Now when

that his sonne had by such good fortune atteined to the dukedome of
Britaine.</p>

<p>At that season in Britaine were certeine Noble men of such strength and
power, that they disdained to acknowledge themselues subiect to any
superior, in somuch that through ambitious desire of rule and
preheminence, they warred continuallie one against an other, to the
great destruction and vtter vndooing of their miserable countrie, so
that the land sometime fruitfull by nature, was as it were a wildernes.
Wherevpon, those that were the weaker, perceiuing themselues too much
oppressed by the stronger, submitted themselues vnto king Henrie, and
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;13.</span>
required his aid and succour. King Henrie reioising to haue so good an

these supplicants and subdued the resistants, notwithstanding their
great puissance, &amp; the strength of the places which they kept.</p>

betwixt the foresaid two kings: which was kindled the more by a
challenge pretended about the sending of the monie ouer into the holie
land, which was gathered within the countie of Tours: for the French
king claimed to send it, by reason that the church there apperteined to

Richard Lucie, lord gouernour of the realme, the sea-coasts were so

time the king caused all his subiects within the realme of England, from

hauing deliuered vnto him hostages, had a promise made them, that the

returning into Normandie, built a goodlie towne and fortresse neere to
Haie de Malafrey, ycleped Beauver.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Haruey de Yuon.</span>
About the same time one Haruey de Yuon, who had married the daughter of
one William Goieth, (that died in his iournie which he tooke into the
holie land) deliuered certeine castels into the hands of king Henrie,
bicause he was in despaire to keepe them against Theobald earle of
Chartres, who through the French kings aid, sought to dispossesse him of
the same castels: wherevpon the war was renewed betwixt the king of
England and the said earle of Chartres. Neuerthelesse king Henrie making
no great accompt of those wars, went into Britaine with his sonne
Geffrey, where going about the countrie to visit the cities and townes,
he reformed many disorders, laieng as it were a maner of a new
foundation of things there, fortifieng the castels, cities and townes,
and communing in courteous manner with the lords and p&eacute;eres of the
countrie, sought to win their good wils: and so in such exercises he
spent a great part of the time.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;16. <br />
1170.</span>
He kept his Christmasse at Nauntes, whither all the great lords and
barons of Britaine resorted to him. The solemnitie of which feast being
past, he entred into the lands of
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
earle Eudo, and wasted the same, till
the said earle submitted himself. At length, after the king had taken
order for the good gouernement of Normandie, and his other countries on
that side the sea, he returned into England in the first w&eacute;eke of March,
but not without great danger, by reason of a tempest that tooke him on
the seas, beginning about midnight, and not ceassing till 9. of the
clocke in the morning, about which houre he came on land at Portesmouth,
not with many of his ships, the rest being tossed and driuen to s&eacute;eke
succour in sundrie cr&eacute;eks and hauens of the land, and one of them which
was the cheefest and newest, was lost in the middle of the flouds,
together with 400. persons, men &amp; women: among whome was Henrie de
Aguell with two of his sons, Gilbert Sullemuy, and Rafe Beumont the
kings physician &amp; houshold seruant.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> Dauid was made knight by K. Henrie as <i>Houedon</i>
hath.</span>
After this the king held his Easter at Winsor, whither William the
Scotish king came with his brother Dauid, to welcome him home, and to
congratulat his happie successe in his businesse on the further side the
seas. They were honorablie enterteined, and at their departure princelie
rewarded. The king thus returned into England, punished the shiriffes of
<span class="rightnote">A prudent consideration of the king.</span>
the land very gr&eacute;euously for their extortion, briberie, and rapine.
After this, studieng how to assure the estate of the realme vnto his
sons, vpon good consideration remembring that no liuing creature was
more subiect to the vncerteintie of death than Adams heires, and that
<span class="rightnote">Mans nature ambitious.</span>
there is ingraffed such a feruent desire in the ambitious nature of man
to gouerne, that so oft as they once come in hope of a kingdome, they
haue no regard either of right or wrong, God or the diuell, till they be
in possession of their desired prey: he thought it not the worst point
of wisedome to foresee that which might happen. For if he should chance
to depart this life, and leaue his sons yoong, and not able to mainteine
wars through lacke of knowledge, it might fortune them through the
ambition of some to be defrauded and disappointed of their lawful
inheritance. Therefore to preuent the chances of fortune, he determined
whilest he was aliue to crowne his eldest sonne Henrie, being now of the
age of 17. yeares, and so to inuest him in the kingdome by his owne act
in his life time: which deed turned him to much trouble, as after shall
appeare.</p>

<p>Being vpon this point resolued, he called togither a parlement of the
lords both spirituall and temporall at London, and there (on S.
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Bartholomews daie) proclaimed his said sonne Henrie fellow with him in
the kingdome, whom after this on the sundaie following, being the
<span class="rightnote">Henrie the son crowned the 18. of Julie saith <i>Matth.

fouret&eacute;enth daie of June 1170. Roger archbishop of Yorke did crowne
according to the manner, being commanded so to doo by the king. This
office apperteined vnto the archbishop of Canturburie, but bicause he
was banished the realme, the king appointed the archbishop of Yorke to
doo it, which he ought not to haue doone without licence of the
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
archbishop of Canturburie within the precinct of his prouince (as was
alledged by archbishop Becket) who complained thereof vnto pope
Alexander, and so incensed the pope, that he being highly moued by his
<span class="rightnote">The archb. of Yorke is forbidden the vse of the sacraments.</span>
letters, forbad not onelie the archbishop of Yorke, but also Gilbert
bishop of London, and Jocelin bishop of Salisburie (who were present at
the coronation) the vse of the sacraments, which made king Henrie far
more displeased with the archbishop Thomas than he was before.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Polydor.</i> The king became seruitor to his
sonne.</span>
Upon the daie of coronation, king Henrie the father serued his sonne at
the table as sewer, bringing vp the bores head with trumpets before it,
according to the maner. Whervpon (according to the old adage,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Immutant mores homines c&ugrave;m dantur honores)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nogap">
<span class="rightnote">Honours change manners.</span>
the yoong man conceiuing a pride in his heart, beheld the standers-by
with a more statly countenance than he had b&eacute;en woont. The archbishop of
Yorke, who sat by him, marking his behauior, turned vnto him, &amp; said;
<span class="rightnote">Yong men set vp in dignitie easilie forget themselues.</span>
"Be glad my good sonne, there is not an other prince in the world that
hath such a sewer at his table." To this the new king answered, as it
were disdainefullie, thus: "Why doost thou maruell at that? My father in
doing it, thinketh it not more than becommeth him, he being borne of
princelie bloud onlie on the mothers side, serueth me that am a king
borne hauing both a king to my father, and a
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
queene to my mother." Thus
the yoong man of an euill and peruerse nature, was puffed vp in pride by
his fathers vnseemelie dooings.</p>

<p>But the king his father hearing his talke, was verie sorrowfull in his
mind, and said to the archbishop softlie in his eare: "It repenteth me,
it repenteth me my lord, that I haue thus aduanced the boy." For he
gessed hereby what a one he would prooue afterward, that shewed himselfe
so disobedient and froward alreadie. But although he was displeased with
himselfe in that he had doone vndiscr&eacute;etlie, yet now when that which was
doone could not be vndoone, he caused all the Nobles and lords of the
realme togither with the king of Scots and his brother Dauid, to doo
homage vnto his said sonne thus made fellow with him in the kingdome:
but he would not release them of their oth of allegiance, wherein they
stood bound to obeie him the father, so long as he liued.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Howbeit some write that he renounced his estate, first before all the
lords of the land, and after caused his sonne to be crowned: but in such
vncerteine points set foorth by parciall writers, that is to be receiued
as a truth, which is confirmed by the order and sequele of things after
doone and put in practise. For true it is, that king Henrie the father
(so long as his sonne liued) did shew himselfe sometime as fellow with
his sonne in gouernement, and sometime as absolute king: and after his
sons decease, he continued in the entier gouernment, so long as he
liued. But to proc&eacute;ed.</p>

<p>The French king hearing that his sonne in law was thus crowned, and not
his daughter the wife of Henrie the sonne, was highlie offended
<span class="rightnote">The French king offended.</span>
therewith, and threatned to make war against king Henrie the father,
except his daughter Margaret might receiue the crowne also as qu&eacute;ene
immediatlie.</p>

<p>The cause why she was not crowned, was by reason of hir yoong yeares,
and for that she had not as yet accompanied with hir husband. But K.
Henrie the father vnderstanding the French kings threats, sailed ouer
into Normandie, where whilest they prepared for war on both sides, by
<span class="rightnote">An enteruiew of the kings. <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
the earnest diligence of Theobald earle of Blois, both the kings came to
an enteruiew at Uendosme, where at length they were accorded, vpon
promise made by king Henrie, that he would cause his sonne to be crowned
againe, and with him his wife the said Margaret the French kings
daughter as qu&eacute;ene.</p>

<p>The French king contented therewith, departed homewards, and king Henrie
returning came to Uernon, where he fell into so great a sicknesse, that
anon it was noised ouer all the countrie. Insomuch that he was in such
<span class="rightnote">He made his testament. <i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
despaire of life, that he made his testament: wherein he assigned his
sonne Richard the dutchie of Aquitaine, and all those lands which came
by qu&eacute;ene Elianor the mother of the same Richard. And to his sonne
Geffrey he bequeathed Britaine (with the daughter of earle Conan) which
he had purchased to his vse of the French king. And to his sonne king
Henrie he gaue the dutchie of Normandie, and all those lands which came
by his father Geffrey earle of Aniou. And to his yoongest sonne John be
bequeathed the earledome of Mortaine. And finally appointed where he
would haue his bodie to be buried.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> King Henrie the sonne his misorder.</span>
In the meane time Henrie the sonne remaining at home in England, fell
from all good order of measure k&eacute;eping, and gaue himselfe to all
excessiue riot, spending and wasting his reuenues inordinatelie. Of
which behauiour his father being aduertised, returned into England,
where he taried not long, but passed ouer againe into Normandie, hauing
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;16. <br />

his said sonne in his companie, meaning thereby to remoue him from the
companie of those that were verie like to corrupt this nature, and frame
the same to all lewdnesse: for he knew that</p>

<p>In this meane while Thomas the archbishop of Canturburie remained in
exile almost six yeares, and could not be restored, till partlie by
swelling threats of the pope, and
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
partlie at the earnest suit of Lewes
the French king, Theobald earle of Blois, and others king Henrie began
somewhat to shew himselfe conformable towards an agr&eacute;ement.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ex&nbsp;Quadrilagio.</i> The king and the arch. Becket met togither
in the presence of the French king.</span>
Wherevpon the two kings met diuerse times, and the archbishop Thomas
comming with the French king, at one time humbled himselfe so to the
king of England, that kn&eacute;eling downe at his f&eacute;et, he said: "My
souereigne liege lord, I commit the whole cause of the controuersie
betwixt your grace and me, vnto your maiesties order, Gods honour onlie
reserued."</p>

<p>The king offended with that ambiguous exception, said to the king of
France: "Whatsoeuer displeaseth this man, is taken (as he interpreteth
it) contrarie to Gods honour, and so by that shift will he chalenge to
himselfe all that belongeth vnto me. But bicause you shall not thinke
that I go about to resist Gods honour, or him, in any reasonable order,
looke what the greatest and most holie of all his ancestors haue doone
vnto the meanest of mine ancestours, let him doo the same vnto me, and I
am contented therewith."</p>

<p>All the companie present cried, "that the king humbled himselfe enough."
"My lord archbishop (said the French king) will you be greater than
saints, and better than saint Peter? Wherof stand you in doubt? Behold,
your peace is at hand." The archbishop made answer in commendation of
<span class="rightnote">The present state of the church in Becket daies.</span>
the present state of holie church, as thus: "My holie predecessours in
their time, although they cut not all things away that extolled it selfe
against God, yet did they cut off diuers: but if they had plucked vp all
by the hard roots, which might offend, who should now haue raised the
fire of temptation against vs? We are in much better case (thanks be to
God) and as we haue laboured in their lot and number, so are we
partakers of their labour and reward. What if any of them had b&eacute;ene
defectiue or excessiue in any point, are we bound to follow the example
of their defection or excesse? We blame Peter for his denieng of Christ,
but we praise him in reproouing of Neros violence with danger of his
life. The church hath risen and increased out of manie dangerous
oppressions, our fathers haue suffered manie things, bicause they would
not forsake the name of Christ; and ought I to suppresse his honour, to
be reconciled vnto any mans fauour? God forbid, God forbid."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The archb. Becket blamed of arrogancie.</span>
When the Noble men present heard this answer of a subiect against his
souereigne, they all held against him, imputing the fault to the
archbishops arrogancie, that the peace was not made betweene the king
and him, insomuch that there was an erle which openlie said; "Sith he
resisteth the will of both the realmes, he is not worthie to be
succoured by either of them from henceforth: and therefore being cast
out of England, let not France receiue him."</p>

<p>The councell then being broken vp, the kings departed without bidding
the archbishop farewell, and such as were mediatours for peace, in
departing from this meeting, spake manie reprochfull words to him,
<span class="rightnote">Archb. Becket wilfull in his owne opinion.</span>
alledging that he had b&eacute;ene euer stout and wise in his owne conceit, and
a folower of his owne will and opinion: adding that it was a great
hinderance to the church, that he was ordeined archbishop, and that by
him the church was alreadie in part destroied, and would shortlie be
altogither brought to vtter ruine.</p>

<p>But the archbishop setting a watch before his mouth, kept silence (as
though he had not heard) and folowed the French king with his people.
Manie said by the waie as they iournied, "Behold the archbishop yonder,
which in talke the last night would not for the pleasure of the king
denie God, nor k&eacute;epe his honor in silence."</p>

<p>After this, when the archbishop was come to Sens, and aduised with
himselfe whether it should be best for him to go, at length he said,
"God is able in the last point of miserie and distresse, to helpe those
that be his." Herewith came a messenger from the French king to bring
him to the court, for the French king (as one that had b&eacute;ene better
instructed in the matter) repented himselfe that he had iudged euill of
his answers at the last meeting, and herevpon receiued him againe into
his fauour, and rested not to trauell
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
so much in his cause, that at
<span class="rightnote">The French K. receiueth the archbishop Becket againe into
fauour.</span>
length another m&eacute;eting was assigned at a certeine place neere the
confines of Normandie, whither king Henrie came, and there found Lewes,
the archbishop of Rouen, and diuerse other bishops together, with the
foresaid archbishop, who after they had reasoned of the matter
throughlie as they saw cause, king Henrie receiued the archbishop into
<span class="rightnote">The archb. is reconciled to the king.</span>
his fauour againe, and promised to redresse all that had b&eacute;ene doone
amisse, and pardon all those that had followed him out of the realme.
Wherevpon the king and the archbishop being reconciled, the archbishop
the same day came before the king, and talked with him.</p>

<p>Now among other things he required of the K. that it might be lawfull
for him (without offending of his maiestie) to punish (according to the
censures of the church) the iniurie doone vnto him by the archbishop of
Yorke, and other bishops in the coronation of his sonne. The king
granted this, and shewed himselfe so courteous at that time, that (as it
is said) he held his stirrup whiles he mounted on horssebacke.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Notwithstanding which obsequiousnes of the king, it is to be presumed
that all inward repining could not be so abolished, as that no fragments
remained: but that the archbishop for his part, for the maintenance of
his great title, &amp; the K. for the supportation of his souereigntie, when
opportunitie serued, sought to get aduantage one of another, &amp; acquit
their harts with a new reuenge of an old grudge: for</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The king would not kisse the pax with the archbishop.</span>
But whereas twise within a few daies after, the king and the said
archbishop met at masse, the king refused to kisse the pax with him.
This was marked as a signe of a fained reconciliation, though in d&eacute;ed he
afterwards interteined him verie courteouslie, and at his departure ouer
into England, tooke leaue of him in fr&eacute;endlie manner, and directed
letters vnder his sele to his sonne the new king in forme as followeth.

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>A letter of the king touching the pacification betweene him and Thomas
Becket.</h3>

<p>Know ye that Thomas the archbishop of Canturburie hath made his peace
with me at my will and pleasure; and therefore I command you, that both
he and his may remaine in peace; and that he and al those which for his
cause departed out of the realme, may haue all their goods restored, and
in such quiet estate be now possessed of them as at any time within
three moneths before their departure from thence. And further, cause to
come before vs of the best and most ancient knights of the honor of
<span class="rightnote">The honor of Saltwood.</span>
Saltwood, that vpon their oths they may find what fee the archbishop
ought to haue within that honor, and that which shall appeare to
apperteine vnto him, as in fee, let him inioy the same. And thus
farewell.</p>

</div>

<p>The archbishop (before he tooke his iournie into England) went to visit
the French king, and to giue him thanks for his great paines and trauell
<span class="rightnote">The French kings aduise to the archbish. Becket.</span>
susteined in his cause, who aduised him in no wise as yet to commit
himselfe to present danger amongst his new reconciled enimies, but
rather to staie till their malice were somewhat assuaged. For he
perceiued by king Henries words &amp; countenance such a deepe rooted
displeasure in his hart, that he agr&eacute;ed to receiue him into fauour
rather by compulsion and against his will than otherwise.</p>

<p>But when the archbishop would needs depart &amp; go ouer into England, the
French K. suffered him so to doo, dooing him all the honor he could at
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> The archbishop Becket returneth into
England.</span>
his leaue taking. Then the archbishop departing out of France, came into
England, and landed at Sandwich about the first of December, in the
seuenth yeare after his first departure out of the realme.
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
Shortlie
after his arriuall, Roger the archbishop of Yorke, Gilbert bishop of
London, and Jocelin bishop of Salisburie, with diuerse other, came vnto
him as to the popes legat, and required that it might please him to
restore them to the ministration of their offices againe; whose request
be granted, but yet vpon condition, that they should vndertake to stand
to his iudgement and order in all things, which (by the counsell of the
archbishop of Yorke) they vtterlie refused.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Here authors agr&eacute;e not (as Polydor trulie saith) for some write that
archbishop Thomas (immediatlie vpon his returne into England) denounced
the archbishop of Yorke with the bishops of Salisburie and London
accurssed, whereas before they were depriued of the vse and
administration of the sacraments. Some others write, that now at his
comming ouer into England from his exile, he depriued them onlie of the
ministration of the sacraments, togither with the bishops of Excester,
Chester, Rochester, S. Asaph, &amp; Landaff, which had personallie b&eacute;ene
present at the coronation of king Henrie the sonne, to the derogation of
the dignitie of their primat the archbishop of Canturburie (as before
you haue heard.) It shuld seeme yet by Ger. Dorober. that the archbishop
of Yorke, and the bishop of Durham were suspended, and the bishops of
London, Salisburie, and diuerse other excommunicated.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The archbish. of Yorke and other go ouer to the king to
complaine of the archbishop Becket. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
But how soeuer he vsed them, the archbishop of Yorke, the two bishops
London and Salisburie, being offended with his dooings, sailed ouer into
Normandie, and there complained to king Henrie of iniuries doone to them
by archbishop Thomas, gr&eacute;euouslie accusing him that he went about to
take awaie their libertie of priesthood, to destroie, corrupt, and
finallie to abolish both the lawes of God and man, togither with the
ancient decr&eacute;es and statutes of their elders; in somuch that he tooke
vpon him to exclude bishops at his pleasure from the companie of
christian men, and so being excluded, to banish them for euer: to
derogat things meerelie preiudiciall to the kings roiall prerogatiue;
and finallie to take awaie from all men the equitie of laws and ciuill
orders.</p>

<p>The king giuing eare to their complaint, was so displeased in his mind
against archbishop Thomas, that in open audience of his lords, knights,
<span class="rightnote">The occasion of the kings words that cost bish. Becket his
life.</span>
and gentlemen, he said these or the like words: "In what miserable state
am I, that can not be in rest within mine owne realme, by reason of one
onelie pr&eacute;est? Neither is there any of my folkes that will helpe to
deliuer me out of such troubles."</p>

<p>There were some that stood about the king, which gessed by these words,
that his mind was to signifie how he would haue some man to dispatch the
archbishop out of the waie. The kings displeasure against the archbishop
was knowne well inough, which caused men to haue him in no reuerence at
all, so that (as it was said) it chanced on a time, that he came to
Strowd in Kent, where the inhabitants meaning to doo somewhat to his
infamie, being thus out of the kings fauour, and despised of the world,
cut off his horsses taile.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The knights that slue the archbishop Becket.</span>
There were some also of the kings seruants, that thought after an other
maner of sort to reuenge the displeasure doone to the kings maiestie, as
sir Hugh Moreuille, sir William Tracie, sir Richard Britaine, and sir
Reignold Fitz Urse, knights, who taking aduice togither, and agr&eacute;eing in
one mind and will, tooke shipping, &amp; sailed ouer into England, landing
at a place called Dogs hauen, n&eacute;ere Douer.</p>

<p>Now the first night they lodged in the castell of Saltwood, which
Randulfe de Broc had in keeping. The next morning (being the 29. of
December, and fift daie of Christmasse, which as that yeare came about
fell vpon a tuesdaie) hauing gotten togither certeine souldiers in the
countrie thereabouts, came to Canturburie, and first entring into the
court of the abbeie of S. Augustine, they talked with Clarenbald the
elect abbat of that place: and after conference had with him, they
proceeded in their businesse as followeth.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Reignold Fitz Urse. That is betw&eacute;ene 4. and 5. in the
euening.</span>
The first knight sir Reignold Fitz Urse came to him about the eleuenth
houre of the daie, as the archbishop sat in his chamber, and sitting
downe at his feet vpon the ground without any manner of greeting or
salutation, at length began with him thus: "Being sent of our souereigne
lord the king from beyond the seas, we doo here present vnto you
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
his
Graces commandements, to wit, that you should go to his sonne the king,
to doo vnto him that which apperteineth vnto you to doo vnto your
souereigne lord, and to do your fealtie vnto him in taking an oth, and
further to amend that wherein you haue offended his maiestie." Wherevnto
the archbishop answered: "For what cause ought I to confirme my fealtie
vnto him by oth? or wherein am I giltie in offending the kings
<span class="rightnote">An oth required of him for his baronie.</span>
Maiestie?" Sir Reignold said: "For your baronie, fealtie is demanded of
you with an oth, and an other oth is required of those clerkes, which
you haue brought with you, if they meane to continue within the land."
The archbishop answered: "For my baronie I am readie to do to the king
whatsoeuer law or reason shall allow: but let him for certeine hold,
that he shall not get any oth either of me or of my clerks." "We knew
that (said the knight) that you would not doo any of these things which
we proponed vnto you. Moreouer the king commandeth you to absolue those
bishops that are excommunicated by you without his licence." Wherevnto
he said: "The bishops are excommunicated not by me, but by the pope, who
hath therto authoritie from the Lord. If in d&eacute;ed he hath reuenged the
inurie doone to my church, I confesse that I am not displeased
therwith." Then said the knight: "Sith that such things in despite of
the king doo please you, it is to be thought that you would take from
him his crowne, and be called and taken for king your selfe, but you
shall misse of your purpose surelie therein." The archbishop answered:
"I do not aspire to the name of a king, rather would I knit three
crownes vnto his crowne if it lay in my power."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The knights command the moonks to s&eacute;e the archbishop kept
safe.</span>
At length after these and such words, the knights turning them to the
moonks, said: "In the behalfe of our souereigne lord the king, we
command you, that in any wise ye keepe this man safe, and present him to
the king when it shall please his grace to send for him." The archbishop
said: "Doo ye thinke that I will run away? I came not to run away, but
looke for the outrage and malice of wicked men." "Truelie (said they)
you shall not runne away," and herewith went out with noise and
<span class="rightnote">John de Salisburie the archb. Beckets chancellor.</span>
threatnings. Then maister John of Salisburie his chancellor said vnto
him: "My lord, this is a woonderfull matter that you will take no mans
counsell: had it not beene m&eacute;et to haue giuen them a more m&eacute;eke and
<span class="rightnote">The archbishops resolution.</span>
gentle answer?" But the archbishop said: "Surelie I haue alreadie taken
all the counsell that I will take, I know what I ought to doo." Then
said Salisburie, "I pray God it may be good." Now the knights departing
out of the place, and going about to put on their armour, certeine came
<span class="rightnote">The knights put on their armor.</span>
to the archbishop, &amp; said; "My lord, they arme themselues." "What
forceth it? said he, let them arme themselues."</p>

<p>Now when they were armed, and manie other about them, they entred into
the archbishops palace. Those that were about the archbishop cried vpon
him to fl&eacute;e; but he sat still and would not once remoue, till the moonks
brought him euen by force &amp; against his will into the church. The
comming of the armed men being knowne; some of the moonks continued
<span class="rightnote">The moonks with force bring the archbishop into the church.</span>
singing of euensong, and some sought places where to hide themselues,
other came to the archbishop, who was loth to haue entred into the
church, and when he was within, he would not yet suffer them to make
fast the doores, so that there was a great stur among them, but cheeflie
when they perceiued that the armed men went about to s&eacute;eke for the
archbishop, by meane whereof their euensong was left vnfinished.</p>

<p>At length the knights with their seruants hauing sought the palace, came
rushing into the church by the cloister doore with their swords drawne,
<span class="rightnote">The knights enter the church.</span>
some of them asking for the traitor, and some of them for the
archbishop, who came and met them, saieng; "Here am I, no traitor, but
<span class="rightnote">As though archbishops can be no traitors.</span>
the archbishop." The formost of the knights said vnto him: "Flee; thou
art but dead," To whome the archbishop said, "I will not fl&eacute;e." The
knight stept to him taking him by the sl&eacute;eue, and with his sword cast
his cap besides his head, and said, "Come hither, for thou art a
prisoner." "I will not (said the archbishop) doo with me here what thou
wilt:" and plucked his sleeue with a mightie strength out of the knights
hand. Wherewith the knight stepped backe two or thr&eacute;e paces. Then the
<span class="rightnote">The courage of the archb.</span>
archbishop turning to one of the knights, said to him, "What meaneth
this, Reignold? I
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
haue doone vnto th&eacute;e manie great pleasures, and
commest thou now vnto me into the church armed?" Unto whome the knight
presentlie answered and said; "Thou shalt know anon what is ment, thou
art but dead: it is not possible for thee any longer to liue." Unto whom
the archbishop answered: "I am readie to die for my God, and for the
defense of his iustice and the libertie of the church; gladlie doo I
imbrace death, so that the church may purchase peace and libertie by the
shedding of my blood." And herewith taking on other of the knights by
the habergeon, he floong him from him with such violence, that he had
almost throwne him downe to the ground. This was sir Will. Tracie, as he
after confessed.</p>

<p>Then the archbishop inclined his head after the maner of one that would
praie, pronouncing these his last words: "To God, to saint Marie, and to
the saints that are patrones of this church, and to saint Denise, I
commend my selfe and the churches cause." Therewith sir Reignold
FitzUrse striking a full blow at his head, chanced to light vpon the
<span class="rightnote">Edward of Cambridge.</span>
arme of a clerke named Edward of Cambridge, who cast vp his arme to saue
the archbishop: but when he was not able to beare the weight of the
blow, he plucked his arme backe, and so the stroke staied vpon the
archbishops head, in such wise that the bloud ran downe by his face.
<span class="rightnote">The archbish. is slaine.</span>
Then they stroke at him one after an other, and though he fell to the
ground at the second blow, yet they left him not till they had cut and
pashed out his braines, and dashed them about vpon the church pauement.
All this being doone, they rifled his house, spoiled his goods, and
tooke them to their owne vses, supposing it lawfull for them being the
kings seruants so to doo.</p>

<p>But doubting how the matter would be taken, after they had wrought their
feat, they got them into the bishoprike of Duresme, there to remaine
till they might heare how the king would take this their vnlawfull
enterprise: though (as they alledged) they had lustilie defended his
cause, and reuenged his quarell as faithfull seruants ought to doo.
Howbeit, it chanced otherwise than they looked it should haue doone: for
king Henrie gaue them so litle thankes for their presumptuous act,
<span class="rightnote">The murtherers come to an euill end. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i>
<i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
sounding to the euill example of other in breach of his lawes, that they
despairing vtterlie of pardon, fled one into one place, and another into
another, so that within foure yeares they all died an euill death (as it
hath b&eacute;ene reported.) Some write, that they went to Rome by the kings
commandement, and there presented themselues before the pope, to receiue
such penance for their wicked act as he should enioine them. Herevpon
the pope appointed them to go vnto Jerusalem, their to do their penance,
where they remained certeine yeares, applieng themselues verie
diligentlie to performe the satisfaction of their offense, according to
the maner prescribed to them by the pope, and so at length died.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;17. <br />

This was the end of Thomas Becket archbishop of Canturburie, which was
after he had entred into that see eight yeares and six moneths, in the
<span class="rightnote">After their account that begin the yere on Christmas day.</span>
yeare after the birth of our Lord 1171. On Christmas day before his
death, which fell that yeare on the fridaie, he preached a sermon to the
people, and when he had made an end thereof, he accurssed Nigell de
Sackeuille, the violent incumbent of the church of Berges, and
<span class="rightnote">Robert de Broc.</span>
 Robert de
Broc, both which had (vpon spite) curtailed the horsse of the said
archbishop: and as the same day whilest he was at the altar, according
to his custome, altogither in teares and lamentation; so at dinner he
shewed himselfe verie pleasant &amp; merrie, insomuch that when those that
were at the table s&eacute;emed somewhat doubtfull to eat of the flesh that was
set before them, bicause it was friday; "Why do ye abhorre (saith he) to
eat flesh? This day flesh hath a great priuilege, for this same day the
word was made flesh, and came into light, and appeared vnto vs." These
his words greatlie contented all the companie.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Thus you haue heard the tragicall discourse of ambitious Becket, a man
of meane parentage, and yet through the princes fauour verie fortunate,
if he had not abused the beneuolence of so gratious a souereigne by his
insolencie and presumption. Wherein we haue to note, how vnseemelie a
thing it was for him, being called to so sacred a function, to lead so
secular and prophane a life, as if he had professed open hostilitie to
the vocation <a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
which he pretended to honour and reuerence. We are also
taught, that promotions atchiued by ambition are not permanent, and are
so farre from procuring fame and renowne to the obteiners, that they
turne them in the end to shame, infamie and reproch, after losse of life
and effusion of bloud. The issue of all which tragedie is to be imputed
to the prouidence and counsell of almightie God, as one writeth verie
agr&eacute;ablie to this purpose, saieng,</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie sorie for the archb. Beckets death. <i>Polydor.</i></span>
But to let this matter passe. King Henrie doubtlesse was right pensiue
for his death, bicause he wist well inough that it would be iudged, that
he himselfe was priuie to the thing: and euen so it came to passe, for
immediatlie vpon notice giuen into France of the archbishops death, king
Lewes, and Theobald the earle of Blois, as they that loued him most
deerelie were most sorowfull for it, and iudging straightwaie that king
Henrie was the procurer, they wrote their letters vnto pope Alexander,
giuing him to vnderstand both of the slaughter, and how king Henrie had
caused it to be put in execution, requiring most instantlie, that such
an iniurie doone to the Christian religion, might sp&eacute;edilie be punished.
The pope was much offended, and determined to haue the matter throughlie
considered and ordered, so as might stand with his dignitie, and
accordinglie as the hainous state of the case required. King Henrie
whilest these things were a dooing, lay certein daies at Argenton, so
much displeased in his mind, that he would suffer no man once to speake
to him about any maner of businesse.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie sendeth ambassadours to the pope.</span>
At length, he sent his ambassadors to Rome, partlie to purge himselfe of
the archbishops death, partlie to excuse his fault, for that in his
furie he had vttered words against the archbishop, which had giuen
occasion to naughtie men to contriue his death, &amp; partlie to require the
pope to send his legats into England, to make inquirie both for the
death of the archbishop, and also of the state of the clergie. The kings
ambassadors found the pope at Tiuoli, and there were heard to declare
their message: but little credit was giuen to their words, in so much
that the pope plainelie told them, that he vnderstood the matter to be
much otherwise than they had declared. Yet according to the kings
request, he sent two of his cardinals into England, which vpon due
examination, might vnderstand the truth of the matter thoroughlie as
apperteined.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
There be that write, that the king sent ambassadours twice vnto the
pope, for the first that went, could not come to his presence, nor be
suffered to declare their message: those that were sent the second time,
were receiued of some of the cardinals, but yet onelie with words
without anie other way of freendlie interteinement. At length, when the
feast of Easter drew n&eacute;ere, on the which either absolution or
excommunication was to be denounced against euerie man, there were
certeine of the cardinals which gaue intelligence to the English
ambassadours, that the pope by aduice of the colledge, meant on the
thursdaie before Easter daie to declare the sentence of interdiction
against the king of England, and against all his dominions, and to
confirme that which had beene alreadie pronounced against Richard the
archbishop of Yorke, and the other bishops his complices.</p>

<p>The ambassadours being brought to a streict issue herewith, by helpe of
some of the cardinals found meanes to haue it put into the popes head,
how the English ambassadours had commission to vndertake, that the king
of England should obeie in all things what order soeuer it pleased the
pope and his court to award him. Herevpon they tooke their oth, that it
should so be, and by that meanes they auoided the interdiction. The
messengers of the archbishop of Yorke &amp; the other bishops vsed the like
shift, but yet the same daie the pope did excommunicate the knights that
had murthered the archbishop Thomas, and all those that had procured,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> The ambassadours were glad to vse a shift by
briberie.</span>
aided, succoured, or abetted them
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
therein. Some write, that those
ambassadours which the king sent to the court of Rome, could not be
suffered to come to the popes presence, till according to the fashion,
they had giuen 500. marks in reward, and so at length were admitted to
his presence.</p>

<p>Howsoeuer that matter passed, the king stood in great feare least his
land should be interdicted, in so much that he commanded the wardens of
the ports both on this side the sea and beyond, to take good h&eacute;ed, least
any c&#333;ming with letters of interdiction should passe into England;
but if any such came, that the bringer should be arrested and committed
to prison. Also he commanded, that no clearke were suffered to come ouer
into England, except he first tooke an oth that he came about no
businesse that might turne to the preiudice of the king or his realme.
This commandement he set forth, at what time he transported ouer into
England himselfe, where he landed this yeare at Portesmouth the third
daie of August. About which time it came into the kings mind, to make a
conquest of Ireland vpon this occasion.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Sundrie rulers in Ireland.</span>
It chanced, whereas diuerse rulers or (as we may call them) petie kings
reigned the same seson in that Iland (which was diuided into seuerall
estates or kingdomes) that continuall strife and dissention remained
amongst them, so that oftentimes they made sore war after the manner of
their countrie one against an other, (for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="rightnote"><i>Luc. lib. 1.</i></span>
<span class="i0">Nulla fides regni socijs, omnisque potestas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatiens consortis erit.)<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Herevpon it fortuned, that one of those kings or rulers, about the 14.
yeare of this kings reigne, was sore afflicted and oppressed by his
neighbours, wherevpon taking aduice what he might best doo for remedie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> S&eacute;e more hereof in Ireland.</span>
in that case, at length he sent his son into England to reteine
souldiours and men of warre, and to bring them ouer vnto his aid in hope
of gaine, &amp; such commodities as he assured them of.</p>

<p>Now it came to passe, that by the assistance of such Englishmen as then
came ouer, the foresaid Irish king began to recouer his losses, and in
the end waxed so strong, that he subdued all his enimies. When he had
thus obteined the victorie, he did not onelie not send backe his aiders,
but so liberallie reteined them still with him, that they had no hast to
returne home, but setled themselues in that countrie, where they liued a
pleasant and verie licentious life. For this cause also the stoutest
lords and rulers of the Irish nation began sore to stomach the matter
against him that had thus brought the English nation into their
countrie, in so much that the Englishmen perceiuing their malice, and
therewithall hauing some feare of themselues, bicause of their small
number, they sent ouer into England for such as wanted liuing, and were
willing to seeke for it in other countries, of which sort, great numbers
went ouer thither within a short space, whereby the multitude of the
English greatlie increased: but for as much as they had no ruler to
<span class="rightnote">Erle Strangbow. <i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
gouerne them, they procured Richard Strangbow earle of Struguille, ali&agrave;s
Chepstow in Wales to come ouer thither, and to receiue the souereigne
gouernement, with such honorable prouision for maintenance of his
estate, as should s&eacute;eme requisit.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
&para;&nbsp;Some write, that this earle Richard (being also earle Marshall of
England) for a rebellion moued against king Henrie, had before this time
forfeited all his lands; but others affirme that through riot and more
sumptuous port than his abilitie might beare, he had made awaie and
consumed the most part of his liuing, and was run so far in debt, that
he knew not how to satisfie his creditors, and therefore was he the
readier to incline to their request, which made labour vnto him to come
ouer into Ireland to haue the gouernance of such English people, as had
alreadie planted themselues there to inhabit &amp; remaine. Herevpon he
prepared a nauie, and assembled togither a great number of such as
<span class="rightnote">Strangbow countermanded.</span>
lacked liuing, and shortlie determined to passe ouer into Ireland. But
euen as he was readie to set forward, there came vnto him messengers
from king Henrie, commanding him to staie, and not to take that iournie
in hand. Howbeit the earle hauing nothing in England whereof to make
anie great accompt, notwithstanding the kings commandement,
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
tooke the
sea, and passed ouer into that countrie, where he greatlie delited such
Englishmen as dailie had looked for his repaire and comming thither.</p>

<p>Shortlie after, ioining those which he brought ouer with him, with the
other that were there before his comming, he thought to worke some feat,
whereby he might make his name famous, &amp; cause the Irishmen to haue him
<span class="rightnote">Dublin won. Additions to <i>Iohn&nbsp;Pike.</i></span>
in feare. Wherevpon he first assailed the citie of Dublin, and by force
wan it. He likewise wan Waterford, &amp; diuerse other townes neere vnto the
sea side. Also to haue some freendship amongst those barbarous people,
<span class="rightnote">Strangbow marrieth Dermutius his daughter.</span>
he married the daughter of the confederate king, and so grew into verie
great estimation in that countrie and region.</p>

<p>Howbeit, with these and the like doings of the earle, king Henrie tooke
such displeasure (but ch&eacute;eflie for disobeieng his commandement) that he
confined him the realme, seized his lands as forfeited, and by
<span class="rightnote">Strangbow confined.</span>
proclamation restreined all his subiects from passing into Ireland with
any kind of merchandize, prouision of vittels, or other commodities
whatsoeuer. By reason whereof, earle Strangbow, partlie by constreint,
<span class="rightnote">He s&eacute;eketh to procure the kings fauour.</span>
and partlie in hope to returne into fauour with king Henrie, and for
other respects as may be coniectured, aduertised him of the whole state
of the countrie of Ireland, promising him, that if it would please his
grace to come ouer thither, he would so worke that he should be admitted

souereigne lord of all the land. Heerevpon king Henrie pardoned him of
all former trespasses, and restored vnto him all his lands and
inheritances within England and Normandie: and further, confirmed to him
such liuings abroad in Ireland out of the walled townes, as he held
alreadie in right of his wife: and furthermore ordeined, that he should
be high steward of Ireland vnder him.</p>

<p>King Henrie then returning out of Normandie into England about the sixt
day of August (as is aforesaid) caused a nauie of 400. ships to be made
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
readie, and to assemble at Milford hauen in Penbrokshire, with all such
prouision and furniture as was thought necessarie for such a iournie.
Herewith also he leuied a great armie both of horssemen and footmen, and
came forward with the same vnto Penbroke, and so when all his prouision
<span class="rightnote">Milford hauen.<br />

and ships were readie, he entred the sea at Milford hauen aforesaid the
sixt&eacute;enth daie of October, and landed in Ireland, at a place called
Crowch, not past seauen miles from Waterford the day next folowing,
about nine of the clocke: and on the morrow after being S. Luke the
euangelists day, he with all his armie marched foorth to Waterford,
where he found William Fitz Aldelme his sewer, and Robert Fitz Bernard,
with other whome he had sent thither before him for such purposes as he
thought most conuenient. He remained at Waterford fift&eacute;ene daies, during
which time, there came in vnto him the king of Corke, the king of
Limerike, the king of Ossorie, the king of M&eacute;eth, Reignald de Waterford,
and diuerse other great princes of Ireland. At his first arriuall, the
<span class="rightnote">The surrender made by erle Strangbow.</span>
foresaid earle Richard surrendred into his hands all those townes and
places which he had subdued in that countrie.</p>

<p>Herewithall the whole land began to tremble, so that the rulers of
townes and countries sent vnto him messengers; offering to become
tributaries, and to deliuer hostages: for whilest euerie of those rulers
<span class="rightnote">Sundrie rulers in a land what weakenes it causeth.</span>
which had the gouernment of Ireland in their hands, feared their owne
estate, and mistrusted their owne powers, they all in maner submitted
themselues, so that this victorie chanced to king Henrie, without the
drawing foorth of his sword, and in such wise, that he could not haue
wished for better or more speedie successe therein. For whereas the
whole Iland was diuided into sundrie dominions, and ruled by sundrie
gouernours, not drawing all one waie, but through factions and contrarie

<p class="nogap">nothing more hindred the fierce and vnquiet nation from making
resistance, than that they could not agr&eacute;e to take councell togither for
defending of their liberties, and entier state of the commonwelth.
Whervpon, whilest euerie of them apart by himselfe was in doubt
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
to
attempt the hazard of war against so mightie a king, they were all
ouercome, as were the Britons likewise in the time of Cesar and the
Saxons. King Henrie therefore gladlie receiued their humble submission,
and they doing homage vnto him, sware to be his liege and faithfull
subiects. Onelie Roderike gouernour of Connagh refused to submit
himselfe.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Roderike K. of Connagh.</span>
This Roderike pretended to be the ch&eacute;efe king of Ireland, and therefore
kept continuall war with the other rulers, which was partlie the cause
wherefore they submitted themselues so soone vnto king Henrie. The said
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Polydor.</i> The nature of the countrie of
Connagh.</span>
Roderike held that part of Ireland which lieth toward the west, being
full of great and thicke woods, and defended with verie high &amp; great
mountaines, closed also with waters and marishes, so that it should be
verie hard, and speciallie in the winter season, to bring an armie vnto
it: which was the onelie cause whie king Henrie attempted nothing
against Roderike at that time, but tooke in hand to plant garisons of
souldiers in places conuenient to k&eacute;epe the land in quiet, which he had
woone alreadie, and to giue order for the gouernement of the whole
estate of the countrie to his behoofe and commoditie. Hervpon going to
Dublin, which is the cheefest citie of all Ireland, he assembled all the
rulers and lords as well spirituall as temporall togither in councell,
consulting with them for the assurance of the dominion of the land to
him and his heires for euermore.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The allegation of the Irishmen.</span>
The Irishmen alleged for themselues, that his deuise therin could not be
compassed, vnles the popes authoritie were therein first obteined: for
they affirmed, that immediatlie vpon receiuing the christian faith, they
did submit themselues, &amp; all that they had, vnto the see of Rome, so
that they could not acknowledge any for their souereigne lord, but
onelie the pope. Which opinion some of them (although vainelie) haue
holden vnto these our daies. King Henrie then vnderstanding this matter,
dispatched ambassadours to Rome, requiring of pope Alexander, that he
would by his authoritie grant him licence to ioine the countrie of
Ireland vnto the realme of England, who went thither with all expedition
according to their charge.</p>

<p>And certeinelie, these ambassadors whom the king sent now out of Ireland
to Rome in this behalfe, returned with better sp&eacute;ed in their message,
than did the other whom he had sent to him out of Normandie, to excuse
him of the death of the archbishop Thomas. For the pope vpon good aduice
taken in this matter (considering that he had now no profit growing to
him by that Ile, and that the Irish people being wild and rude, were far
off from all good order of christianitie in diuerse points) thought it
would be a meane to bring some gaine to his cofers, and the people more
easilie from their naughtie customes, if they were once made subiect
vnto some christian prince of puissance able to tame them, and
constreine them by force to be more meeke and tractable. In
consideration wherof, he was content to grant vnto the king all that
herein he required.</p>

<p>Herevpon, king Henrie considering in what respect the pope was so readie
to accomplish his request, called a councell of the bishops to assemble
<span class="rightnote">A councell at Cassill.</span>
at Cassill, where manie things were decr&eacute;ed and ordeined for the

m&eacute;erelie repugnant to the lawes of the christian religion. There were

with the Irish bishops, one of the kings chaplaines named Nicholas, and

<p>1 Amongst other things there concluded, it was ordeined, that children
shuld be brought to the church, there to receiue baptisme in faire
water, with thr&eacute;e dippings into the same, in the name of the father, the
sonne, and the Holie-ghost, and that by the pr&eacute;ests hands, except in
case where danger of death was feared, which then might be doone by any
other person, and in any other place.</p>

<p>2 Also it was ordeined, that tithes should be paid to churches, and that

lawes of holie church, and not otherwise.</p>

3 The Peter pence also that Adrian reserued in his buls, sent to the
king touching the same matter in the beginning of his reigne (with
diuerse other things) were in like maner appointed to be paid, so that
nothing was omitted that might pleasure the pope, or recouer his
gratious fauour alreadie lost in the matters of Thomas Becket, whereof
you haue alreadie heard. Thus you heare what successe our ambassadours
had in this voiage. &para;&nbsp;Now will I tell you (yer I proc&eacute;ed any further)
what strange things did happen in England whilest the king was thus
occupied in Ireland, and within the compasse of that yeare, and first of

all, in the night before Christmas day last passed, there chanced such a

tempest of lightning and thunder, that the like had not bin heard of,
which tempest was not onelie generallie throughout all England, but also
in other foreine parts n&eacute;ere adioining, namelie in Ireland, where it
continued all that night, and Christmas daie following, to so great
terror of the people, that they looked for present death.</p>

<p>The same night at Andeuer in Hamshire, a pr&eacute;est being in his praiers
before the altar, was striken with the tempest, so that he died yer it
was nine of the clocke in the morning. Also, a temporall man that was

there the same time, was burned with the lightning, and whereas his
brother being present, ran to him to haue succoured him, he likewise was
caught with the fire, and in like maner consumed. In Ireland also, euill

Wherfore, about the beginning of Lent, the king remoued from Dublin, &amp;
went vnto the citie of Wexford, where he remained till toward Easter,
and then prepared to returne into England: but before he tooke the sea,
he gaue and by his charter confirmed to Hugh Lacie, all the lands of
<span class="rightnote">The kings gift vnto Hugh Lacie.</span>
Meeth, with the appurtenances, to hold of him &amp; his heires in fee by
knights seruice, as to find him an hundred knights or men of armes (as
we may terme them) for euermore. He gaue also vnto the same Hugh, the
k&eacute;eping of the citie of Dublin, and made him ch&eacute;efe iusticer of Ireland.
Unto Robert Fitz Bernard he committed the cities of Waterford and
Wesseford, that he should k&eacute;epe the same to his vse, and build in them
castels, for a more sure defense against the enimies.</p>

<p>Thus when the king had planted garisons of souldiers in those &amp; other
places also where was thought n&eacute;edfull; and further had giuen order for
the politike gouernement of the whole countrie, so far as he had
conquered; he first sent ouer his houshold seruants, which tooke the
water on Easter daie, and landed at Milleford, but he himselfe and other
of the Nobles staid there all that daie, by reason of the high
solemnitie of that feast: howbeit the daie next after they tooke the sea
togither, and landed n&eacute;ere to S. Dauids in south Wales, from thence
<span class="rightnote">The king returneth into England. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> The popes
legats.</span>
(without delaie) he hasted foorth to Douer, and hauing his sonne the
yoong king with him, he sailed ouer into Normandie in the crosse weeke
to meet the popes legats, whom he vnderstood to be alreadie come
thither. At his m&eacute;eting with them there, he gaue them verie good
countenance, and right honorable enterteinment, omitting nothing that
might doo them pleasure.</p>

<p>Here when the matter came to be discussed touching the death of
archbishop Thomas, bicause it could not be certeinelie tried out in whom
the fault rested, much reasoning to and fro passed, about obiections and
excuses laid (as in doubtfull cases it often happeneth) so that welneere
the space of foure moneths was spent in debating of that matter. In
which meane time, the king to auoid all contention and strife betwixt
him and king Lewes, sent his son Henrie togither with his wife ouer into
England there eftsoones to receiue the crowne, and with them came Rotrod
the archbishop of Rouen, Giles bishop of Eureux, Roger bishop of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Worcester, and diuerse others.</p>

<p>Herevpon the yoong king being arriued in England, called an assemblie of
the lords spirituall and temporall at Winchester, where both he and his
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
said wife Margaret daughter to the French king was crowned with all
solemnitie, by the hands of the said Rotrod archbishop of Rouen vpon the
twentie one of August.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
In the meane time (saith one writer) his father
king Henrie might haue fores&eacute;ene and found means to haue auoided the
discord, which euen now began to spring vp betwixt him and his children,
causing a sore and ciuill warre, if he had not beene a man that vtterlie
did detest all superstitious admonitions. For being told (I wot not by
whome) that if he did not repent, and take more regard to minister
iustice, which is a vertue that conteineth in it selfe all other
vertues; it would come to passe, that within short time he should fall
into great and manifold calamities.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A strange apparition.</span>
"In his returne also out of Ireland (saith an other) vpon the sundaie
next after the feast of Easter, commonlie called Lowsundie, as he should
take his horsse at Cardiffe in Wales, there appeared vnto him a man of
pale and wanne colour, barefooted, and in a white kirtell, who boldlie
in the Dutch language spake vnto him, and admonished him of amendment of
life, and to haue regard that the sabboth daie (commonlie called the
sundaie) might be more duelie kept and obserued, so that no markets nor
bodilie workes be holden, vsed, or doone vpon that day within the bounds
of his dominions, except that which apperteineth to dressing of meats.
And if thou doo (saith he) after this commandement, I assure th&eacute;e that
all things which thou dooest enterprise of good intent and purpose,
shall sort to good effect and verie luckie end.</p>

<p>"But the king was not greatlie pleased with these words, and in French
said to the knight that held his bridle; 'Aske of this churle, whether
he had dreamed all this that he telleth or not.' When the knight had
expounded it in English, the man answered, Whether I haue dreamed it in
my sleepe or not, take thou h&eacute;ed to my words, &amp; marke what day this is:
for if thou amend not thy life, and doo as I haue aduertised th&eacute;e,
before a twelue moneth come to an end, thou shalt heare such tidings as
will make thee sorowfull all the daies of thy life after." The man
hauing thus spoken, vanished awaie suddenlie, and the king tooke his
words but in sport: howbeit he woondered that he was so suddenlie gone,
as he did likewise at his sudden appearing. Manie other warnings the
king had (saith mine author) but he set little thereby.</p>

<p>The second warning he receiued of an Irishman, that told him of tokens
verie priuie. The third time a knight of Lindsey, called Philip de
Chesterby, passing the sea, came to the king into Normandie, and there
declared vnto him seauen articles, which he should amend, which if he
did, then he should reigne seauen yeares in great honor, and subdue Gods
enimies. If he did not amend and redresse those points, then should he
come to death with dishonour in the fourth yeare.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1 The first article or point was, that he should s&eacute;eke to mainteine
holie church.</p>

<p>2 The second, that he should cause rightfull lawes to be executed.</p>

<p>3 The third, that he should condemne no man without lawfull processe.</p>

<p>4 The fourth, that he should restore the lands, goods and heritages to
those rightfull owners from whome he had taken them by any wrong or
vnlawfull meanes.</p>

<p>5 The fift, that he should cause euerie man to haue right, without
bribing and giuing of m&eacute;ed.</p>

<p>6 The sixt, that he should paie his debts as well due to any of his
subiects, for any stuffe taken vp of them to his vse, as to his seruants
and souldiers, who bicause they could not haue their wages truelie paid
them, fell to robbing and spoiling of true labouring men.</p>

<p>7 The seauenth and last article was, that he should cause the Jewes to
be auoided out of the land, by whom the people were sore impouerished
with such vnmercifull vsurie as they exercised.</p>
</div>

<p>The king (notwithstanding these and other like warnings) tooke no regard
to the amendment of his sinfull life, wherevpon (as is thought) the
troubles which ensued did light vpon him by Gods iust appointment.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Howsoeuer this may s&eacute;eme a fable, but no written veritie, &amp; therefore
esteemed as the chaffe of summer flowers; yet as in the tales of Aesop
many good morals are
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
comprised, so the scope whereto this apparition
tendeth being necessarie, maketh the argument it selfe of the more
authoritie. The end therefore being (as you s&eacute;e) to reuoke the king from
woorse to better, from the swines-stie of vice to the statelie throne of
vertue, from the kennell of sinne to the riuers of sanctitie, prooueth
that euen verie fictions of poets (though of light credit) haue their
drift manie times to honest purpose, and therefore bring with them a
competent weight of profit to the readers. So the scope of this tale
being the same that Dauid pointeth at in the second psalme, when he
saith,</p>

<p class="nogap">maketh the narration it selfe (though otherwise s&eacute;eming m&eacute;ere fabulous)

and now to saie somewhat of this Henrie the seconds sonne the yoong

receiued the crowne togither with his said wife, they both passed the

twentith of September, at a generall assemblie holden within the citie
of Auranches in the church of the apostle S. Andrew, king Henrie the
father, before the cardinals the the popes legats, and a great number of
bishops and other people, made his purgation, in receiuing an oth vpon
the holie relikes of the saints, and vpon the sacred euangelists, that
he neither willed, nor commanded the archbishop Thomas to be murthered,
and that when he heard of it, he was sorie for it. But bicause he could
not apprehend them that slue the archbishop, and for that he feared in
his conscience least they had executed that vnlawfull act vpon a
presumptuous boldnesse, bicause they had perceiued him to be offended
with the archbishop, he sware to make satisfaction (for giuing such
occasion) in this maner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">O vile subiection vnbes&eacute;eming a king!</span>
1 In primis, that he would not depart from pope Alexander, nor from his
catholike successours, so long as they should repute him for a catholike
king.</p>

<p>2 Item, that he would neither impeach appeales, nor suffer them to be
impeached, but that they might freelie be made within the realme vnto
the pope, in causes ecclesiasticall; yet so, that if the king haue the
parties suspected, they shall find him suerties that they shall not
procure harme or hinderance whatsoeuer to him or to his realme.</p>

<p>3 Item, that within thr&eacute;e yeares after the natiuitie of our lord next
ensuing, he should take vpon him the crosse, and personallie passe to
the holie land, except pope Alexander or his successours tooke other
order with him.</p>

<p>4 Prouided, that if vpon any vrgent necessitie he chanced to go into
Spaine to warre against the Saracens there, then so long space of time
as he spent in that iournie, he might deferre his going into the east
parts.</p>

<p>5 Item, he bound himselfe in the meane time by his oth, to emploie so
much monie as the templers should thinke sufficient for the finding of
two hundred knights or men of armes, for one yeares terme in the defense
of the holie land.</p>

<p>6 Item, he remitted his wrath conceiued against those which were in
exile for the archbishop Thomas his cause, so that they might returne
againe into the realme.</p>

<p>7 Item, to restore all the lands and possessions which had b&eacute;ene taken
awaie from the s&eacute;e of Canturburie, as they were belonging thereto in the
yere before the departure of the archbishop Thomas out of England.</p>

<p>8 Item, he sware to take awaie and abolish all those customes, which in
his time had b&eacute;ene brought in against the church, as preiudiciall
thereto.</p>
</div>

<p>All these articles faithfullie, and without male-ingene to performe and
fulfill in euerie degr&eacute;e, he receiued a solemne oth, and caused his
sonne the yoong king being there present, to receiue the same for
performance of all those articles, such as touched his owne person
onelie excepted. And to the intent the same should remaine in the popes

<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
consistorie as matter of record, he put his seale vnto the writing
wherein the same articles were ingrossed, togither with the seales of
the aboue mentioned cardinals.</p>

<p>Shortlie after king Henrie the father suffered the yoong king his son to
go into France, togither with his wife, to visit his father king Lewes,
according as their deputies required, which iournie verelie bred the
cause of the dissention that followed betwixt him and his father. King
Lewes most louinglie receiued them (as reason was) and caused diuers
kinds of triumphant plaies and pastimes to be shewed for the honour and
delectation of his sonne in law and daughter.</p>

<p>Neuerthelesse, whilest this yoong prince soiourned in France, king Lewes
not hartilie fauouring the king of England, and therewithall perceiuing
<span class="rightnote">The French king s&eacute;eketh to sow sedition betwixt the father

the rash and headstrong disposition of the yong king did first of all
inuegle him to consider of his estate, and to remember that he was now a
king equall vnto his father, and therefore aduised him so shortlie as he
could, to get the entire gouernment out of his fathers hands: wherevnto
he furthermore promised all the aid that laie in him to performe.</p>

<p>The yong king being readie inough not onelie to worke vnquietnesse, but
also to follow his father in lawes counsell (as he that was apt of
nature to aspire to the sole gouernement, and loth to haue any partener
in authoritie (according to that of the tragedie-writer,</p>

<p class="nogap">and namelie such one as might controll him) was the more encouraged
thereto by a number of prodigall currie fauours, who by flatterie set
him aloft, declaring vnto him that he was borne to rule, and not to
obeie, and therefore it became not his highnesse to reigne by the
appointment of an other, but rather to haue the gouernement fr&eacute;elie in
his owne hands, that he might not be counted prince by permission.
Herevpon the youthfull courage of the yong king being tickled, began to
wax of a contrarie mind to his father: who suspecting ind&eacute;ed that which
chanced; to wit (least his sonnes yoong yeares not able yet to discerne
good and wholesome counsell from euill, might easilie be infected with
some sinister practise) thought it not good to suffer him to be long
absent from him, and therefore sent for him: who taking leaue of his

father in law king Lewes in courteous maner, returned and came to his

father king Henrie into Normandie, who when the feast of Christmas drew
n&eacute;ere, repaired towards Aniou, where in the towne of Chinon, he
solemnized that feast, hauing left his sonne the yong king and his wife
all that while in Normandie: but sending for him after the feast was
<span class="rightnote">Hubert earle of Morienne.</span>
ended, they went both into Auvergne, where being at mount Ferrat, Hubert
earle of Morienne came vnto them, bringing with him his eldest daughter
Alice, whom king Henrie the father bought of him for the summe of fiue
<span class="rightnote">A marriage contracted.</span>
thousand markes, that he might bestow hir in marriage vpon his yongest
sonne John with the heritage of the countie of Morienne, if hir father
died without other issue, or at the leastwise the said Hubert chanced to
haue any sonne lawfullie begotten, that then he should leaue vnto them
<span class="rightnote"><i>Comitatus&nbsp;bellensis.</i></span>
and to their heires the countie of Russellon, the countie of Belle, as
he then had and held the same, Pierre castell with the appurtenances,
the vallie of Noualleise, also Chambrie with the appurtenances, Aiz,
Aspermont, Rochet, mont Magor, and Chambres, with Burg, all which lieng
on this side the mountaines with their appurtenances, the said Hubert
granted to them immediatlie for euer. And beyond the mountaines he
couenanted to giue vnto them Turine with the appurtenances, the colledge
of Gauoreth with the appurtenances, and all the f&eacute;es which the earles of
Canaues held of him, togither with the fealties and seruices. And also,
the fees, fealties, and seruices which belonged to him in the countie of
Amund, and in the vallie called Vale Dosta; and in like maner, the towne
of Castellone.</p>

<p>All the forenamed places the said earle gaue and granted to the said
John, sonne to the king of England for euermore, with his daughter, so
fr&eacute;elie, wholie and quietlie (in men and cities, castels, fortresses, or
other places of defense, in medowes, leassewes, milnes, woods, plaines,
waters, vallies and mountaines, in customes and all other things)
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
as
euer he or his father had held or enioied the same. And furthermore, the
said earle would, that immediatlie (when it pleased the king of England)
his people should doo homage and fealtie to the king of Englands sonne,
reseruing the fealtie due to him so long as he liued. Moreouer, the said
earle Hubert granted to the said John and his wife all the right that he
<span class="rightnote">The countie of Granople.</span>
had in the countie of Granople, and whatsoeuer might be got and euicted
in the same countie. It was also couenanted, if the elder daughter died,
that then the said John should marrie the yoonger daughter, and enioy
all the like portions and parts of inheritance as he should haue enioied
with the first.</p>

<p>Finallie, that these couenants, grants and agr&eacute;ements should be
performed on the part and behalfe of the said earle Hubert, both he, the
said earle, and the erle of Geneua, and in maner all the great lords and
barons of those countries receiued an oth, and vndertooke to come and
offer themselues as hostages to remaine with the king of England, in
case the said earle Hubert failed in performance of any of the aforesaid
articles, till he framed himselfe to satisfie the kings pleasure in such
behalfe.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Peter the reuerend archbishop of Tarensasia, and Ardune the
bishop of Geneua, and also William the bishop of Morienne, with the
abbat of S. Michell promised vpon their oth to be readie at the
appointment of the king of England, to put vnder the censures of the
church the said earle and his lands, refusing to performe the foresaid
couenants, and so to k&eacute;epe him and the said lands bound, till he had
satisfied the king of England therein.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The earles of Mandeuille and Arundell.</span>
William earle of Mandeuill, and William earle of Arundell sware on the
part of king Henrie, that he should performe the articles, couenants and
agr&eacute;ements on his part, as first to make paiment immediatlie vnto the
said Hubert of one thousand markes, and as soone as he should receiue
his daughter, he should paie him an other thousand markes at the least,
and the residue then remaining of the said sum of fiue thousand markes,
should be paid when the mariage was consummate.</p>

<p>It was prouided also, that the said earle Hubert might marrie his
yoonger daughter where he would, without any great diminishing of the
earledome after the first marriage consummate with the lord John, the
king of Englands sonne. And that if either the said lord John, or his
affianced wife chanced to die before the consummation of the marriage,
then should the monie which the earle had receiued, be repaid to the
king, or bestowed as the king should appoint.</p>

<p>Shortlie after that the parties were agreed vpon the couenants afore
cited, the marques of Montferrat &amp; one Geffrey de Plozac with his sonne
Miles and other Noble men came to the king as ambassadors from the earle
of Morienne, and receiued an oth, that they should see and procure the
said earle to performe the couenants and agreements concluded betwixt
the king and him. When these things were thus ordered, as s&eacute;emed good to
both parties, for the establishment of the foresaid marriage, the king
<span class="rightnote">The earle of S. Giles.</span>
the father, and the king the sonne remoued to Limoges, whither the earle
of S. Giles came, and was there accorded with king Henrie and his sonne
Richard duke of Guien, concerning the controuersie that had b&eacute;ene moued
for the countie of Tholouze, dooing his homage as well vnto the father
<span class="rightnote"><i>Nic.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
as to the sonne for the same countie, and further couenanted to serue
them with an hundred knights or men of armes (as we may call them) for
the terme of fourtie daies at all times, vpon lawfull summons. And if
the king or his sonne duke Richard would haue his seruice longer time
after the fourtie daies were expired, they should paie wages both to him
and his men in reasonable maner. Moreouer, the said earle condescended &amp;
<span class="rightnote">Tribute for Tholouze.</span>
agreed to give yearelie for Tholouze an hundred marks, or else 10.
horsses with 10. marks a p&eacute;ece. Now also, whilest the king soiourned at
Limoges, the earle of Morienne came thither to him, and required to
vnderstand what parcels of land he would assigne vnto his sonne John.

imagined, and now began to put in practise, vsing the opportunitie of

an euill life as he well shewed, in that he wasted the goods of the
church inordinatlie. Roger the abbat of Bechellouin was first chosen,
but he refused that dignitie rather for slothfulnes and idlenes (as some

the people, which measure all things to be honest or dishonest, as they

iusticer giuing his assent therevnto, where a councell was held the same
time, and a letter of the popes read there before the bishops and barons
of the realme, conteining amongst other things this that followeth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>A breefe extract or clause of a letter which the pope sent to the
clergie of England, &amp;c. for the making of a new holie daie.</h3>

<p>We admonish you all, &amp; by the authoritie which we reteine, doo
streightlie charge you, that you celebrat the daie of the suffering of
the blessed man Thomas the glorious martyr, sometime archbishop of
Canturburie, euerie yere in most solemne sort, &amp; that with deuout
praiers ye endeuour your selues to purchase forgiuenes of sins: that he
which for Christes sake suffered banishment in this life, and martyrdome
in death by constancie of vertue, through continuall supplication of
faithfull people, may make intercession for you vnto God.</p>
</div>

<p>The tenor of these letters were scarslie read, but euerie man with a
lowd voice began to recite this psalme or hymne, Te Deum laudamus.
Furthermore bicause his suffragans had not exhibited due reuerence to
him their father, either in time of his banishment, or at his returne
from the same, but rather persecuted him; that they might openlie
confesse their errour and wickednesse to all men, they made this
<span class="rightnote">A collect deuised in honor of the archbishop Becket.</span>
collect: "Be fauourable good Lord to our supplication and praier, that
we which acknowledge our selues guiltie of iniquitie, may be deliuered
by the intercession of Thomas thy blessed martyr and bishop, Amen."</p>

<p>This praier was vsed by the couent of S. Albons on the daie of his

they not all defaced? are they not all ruinated? are they not all
conuerted to powder and dust? And although the pope ment by causing such

ambitious and traitorous heart to all successions. Naie, whereas in

martyr, now it is come to passe (by the meanes belike of other saints
whose merits haue surpassed Beckets) that he is growne in obliuion euen

This yeare the sister of the said archbishop Richard was made abbesse of
Berking. But now touching the new elected archbishop Richard, we find
that comming to Canturburie on the saturdaie after his election, in hope
to be there consecrated, he was disappointed by letters that came from
king Henrie the sonne, in forme as followeth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3><a name="Letter1" id="Letter1"></a>A letter of yoong king Henrie touching the disappointment of archbishop
Richards consecration.</h3>

<p>Henrie by the grace of God king of England, duke of Normandie, and earle
of Aniou, sonne of king Henrie; to our deere and faithfull freend Odo,
prior of the Church of Canturburie, and to all the conuent there,
sendeth greeting. By the assured report of some we vnderstand, that in
your church and in other churches also, my father goeth about to
institute certein persons not verie meet for such calling: and bicause
(without our consent) it ought not so to be doone, who by reason of our
kinglie annointing haue taken vpon vs the kingdome and charge of the
whole realme: hervpon we haue in the presence of many persons appealed
to the see of Rome, and haue signified our appeale in that behalfe, made
vnto our reuerend fathers and freends Albert and Theodorike, cardinals
and legats of the apostolike see, by our writing and messenger, who like
wise and discreet personages haue assented therevnto. We haue likewise
signified the same our appeale to our faithfull freends the bishops of
London, Excester, and Worcester, and as we haue appealed, so likewise we
do appeale vnder your testimonie.</p>
</div>

<p>After the perusall of this letter, and the due consideration of the
substance and summe of the same, (albeit no such afterclaps were
suspected before) the bishops were altogither driuen to their shifts,
some of them desiring to go forward with the consecration, and
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
some
supposing it better to y&eacute;eld vnto the appeale. The elect archbishop
therefore first sent messengers to Rome with letters, not written onelie
by himselfe, but also by all the bishops and conuent of Canturburie.
After this he followed himselfe in person, and comming to the popes
court, found there diuers aduersaries to his cause. For some were there
that tooke part with the king the father, and some with the king the
sonne, and so his businesse could haue no sp&eacute;edie dispatch. In the meane
time the rancor which king Henrie the sonne had concerned against his
father was so ripened, that it could not but burst out, and shew itselfe
to the breach of all dutifull obedience which nature requireth of a
sonne towards his father.</p>

<p>You haue heard how king Henrie promised the earledome of Morienne, when
the marriage was concluded betwixt his son John and the said earles
daughter, to giue vnto the said John certeine townes in Normandie, for
the better mainteining of his estate and his wiues. This gift of the
fathers caused his eldest sonne the yong king Henrie, the sooner to
powre out his poison which he had sucked before at his being with his
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
father in law king Lewes. For conceiuing an offense, that his father
should giue away any portion of his inheritance, he would not condescend
to any such gifts, but alledged that sithens he was king of England, and
that all belonged to him, his father could not now haue any title to
giue awaie that which did in no wise apperteine vnto him.</p>

<p>There was another cause that troubled his mind also, and mooued him to
grudge at his father, which was; for that the proportion of his
allowance for maintenance of his houshold and port was verie slender,
and yet more slenderlie paied. Also his father remooued from him
<span class="rightnote">Astulfe de S. Hilarie a counsellor, or rather corrupter of
king Henrie the sonne. <i>Polydor.</i></span>
certeine of his seruants, as Astulfe de S. Hilarie, and other whome he
suspected to giue him euill counsell. Wherefore those that were
procurers of him to attempt the seizing of the gouernement into his
hands, vpon this occasion slept not, but put into his head such matter,
that at length he openlie demanded to haue the whole rule committed to
him: which when he saw would not be obteined of his father by quiet
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie the sonne fled to the French king.</span>
meanes, he fled secretlie awaie vnto his father in law king Lewes,
requiring aid of him to recouer his right, which king Henrie the elder
vniustlie deteined from him.</p>

<p>The French king comforted him, and bad him be of good cheare, for he
ment to doo for him all that in him laie. Herewith he proclaimed him
duke of Normandie, and receiued homage of him for the same. King Henrie
the father vnderstanding that his sonne was thus tied to the French
king, sent ambassadours foorthwith to the same king, requiring him to
giue his son some good &amp; wholesome counsell, that he might repent, and
not follow such wilfulnesse of mind in swaruing from his fathers
freendship, but rather with sp&eacute;ed to returne home againe; &amp; to promise
in his name, that if any thing were otherwise than well, he would be
contented the same should be reformed by his order and correction. But
so farre was king Lewes from meaning to set a quietnesse betwixt the
father and the sonne, that he would not heare the ambassadors declare
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
their message, bicause they named the father, king, to the derogation of
the sonnes right, to whome he said he offered manifest wrong in vsurping
the gouernement, which he had alreadie giuen ouer and resigned. Insomuch
that when the ambassadours had declared some part of their message, he
asked them what he was that willed such things of him: and when they
answered that the king of England had sent them with that message, "That
is a false lie (saith he) for behold here is the king of England, who
hath giuen you no commission to declare any message from him vnto me at
all."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie the father knoweth not whome he may trust.
<i>Polydor.</i></span>
King Henrie the father perceiuing hereby that warres would follow,
prepared the best he could for his owne defense: but he was in great
doubt on euerie side, not knowing whome he might trust. And to increase
this misch&eacute;efe, his wife qu&eacute;ene Elianor studied to mainteine the strife
betwixt hir sonnes. The yoong king then getting an armie togither entred
into Guian.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Richard Bart chancellor to the young king, also his
chaplaine, Sir Walter Ailward with others. <i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
King Henrie was not hastie to go against him, but sought rather with
gentlenesse and all courteous meanes to reconcile him: insomuch that
whereas diuerse graue personages being of the yoong kings counsell, and
doubting to runne into the displeasure of his father, reuolted from the
sonne to the father, and brought with them the sonnes seale, which he
vsed in sealing of letters. Howbeit, the father receiued them not, but
sent them backe againe to his sonne, commanding them to continue
faithfull in seruing him as he should appoint them, and herewith he sent
ambassadours vnto his sonne to entreate with him of peace and concord.</p>

<p>Now whilest the father went about to asswage the sonnes displeasure, the
mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor did what she could to pricke him forward in his
disobedient attempts. For she being enraged against hir husband bicause
he kept sundrie concubines, and therefore delited the lesse in hir
companie, cared not what misch&eacute;efe she procured against him. Herevpon
she made hir complaint so greeuouslie vnto hir sons Richard and Geffrey,
that they ioined with their brother against their father, &amp; came to him
into Guien, to aid him to the vttermost of their powers.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;This may well s&eacute;eme to be brought vpon the king as a plague of his
incontinent, vnchast and libidinous life; who hauing Chara coniugij
pignora, a notable motiue to kindle and to continue honest loue in
wedlocke, did not notwithstanding most inordinatelie abandon his bodie
to beastlie and vnlawfull companie k&eacute;eping with strange flesh. Note
heere how God stirreth vp the wife of his owne bosome, &amp; the sonnes
descending of his owne loines to be thornes in his eies and godes in his
sides for profaning so diuine and holie an ordinance; which the verie
pagans did so honour and reuerence, that they did not onlie giue
precepts touching the due obseruation thereof, but denounced vndoubted
vengeance for the violation of the same, as appeareth in this old
testimonie,</p>

<p>But we will remit this to the readers consideration, and note the issue
of this misch&eacute;efe now broched. The yoong king reioicing that he had his
brethren thus on his side, readie to take his part, became more stout
than before, and for answere vnto the messengers that came to him from
his father, he declared that if his father would deliuer vp the whole
gouernment into his hands, he would be content to breake vp his armie.
As for such souldiers as would willinglie take his part in this quarell,
he caused them to sweare that they should faithfullie serue him against
his aduersaries: and those that had rather serue on the other side, he
licensed them fr&eacute;elie to depart and go to his father.</p>

<p>King Henrie the father receiuing such a rebellious answer from his
sonne, much lamented the matter, and so much the more, for that he saw
there was no remedie, but
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
to haue the controuersie decided by the
sword. Therefore least he should be taken vnprouided, he kept his armie
<span class="rightnote">Tw&#275;tie thousand Brabanders were reteined by king Henrie
the father as saith <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
in a readinesse about him, hauing reteined certeine bands of Brabanders
called the Rowts.</p>

<p>The lords that tooke part with his sonne, being aduertised by espials of
the dooings of the father, and hearing that he was readie (if he were
constreined) to defend himselfe by battell, and yet willing to receiue
his sons into his fauour againe, if they would be reformed, they tooke
great care how to cause his sons to persist in their enterprise, till
the father were compelled by force to resigne the gouernment vnto them.
But none more than the French king coueted to mainteine the discord,
till it might be ended by force of armes: and therefore sent vnto king
Henrie the sonne, willing him to come to Paris, where he caused a
councell to be called, &amp; there made a league betwixt the said Henrie and
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
himselfe, with William king of Scotland, Hugh earle of Chester, William
Patrike the elder, the thr&eacute;e sons of Robert earle of Mellent, whose
castels king Henrie the elder had in possession, Roger Moumbray, Hugh
Bigot, and diuerse other complices of the conspiracie, Flabella
seditionum, that tooke part with Heurie the sonne.</p>

<p>Here after they had consulted of the maner how to mainteine warre,
<span class="rightnote">The French king taketh an oth to aid Henrie the sonne. <i>Rog.
Houed.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
bicause they would assure the yoong king that they ment not to forsake
him, first king Lewes, and after that all the residue tooke an oth to
aid him with men and monie, till his father should either be driuen out
of his kingdome, or brought to agr&eacute;e with him at his will and pleasure.
On the other part, he sware neuer to conclude any peace with his father
without their consent and good will. He also promised vpon his oth to
<span class="rightnote">Philip earle of Flanders.</span>
giue, &amp; by his charter vnder his scale he confirmed vnto Philip earle of
Flanders (for his homage) a thousand pounds of yearlie reuenues in
England, and the countie of Kent, with the castles of Douer and
<span class="rightnote">Matthew earle of Bullongne.</span>
Rochester. And to Matthew earle of Bullongne (for his homage) he
likewise promised and confirmed the Soke of Kirketon in Lindsey, and the
earledome of Morton, with the honour of Hey. Also to Theobald earle of
Blois (for his homage) he gaue and granted fiue hundred marks of yearlie
reuenue in Aniou with the castell of Ambois, and all that which he
claimed as his right within the countrie of Touraine, and surrendred to
him all the right which he and his father claimed and demanded to haue
<span class="rightnote">Chateau Reignold.</span>
in Chateau Reignold. To the K. of Scots (for his assistance) he gaue and
granted all Northumberland as far as the riuer of Tine. And to his
<span class="rightnote">Earle Dauid.<br />
Hugh Bigot.</span>
brother Dauid (to haue his seruice) he granted the counties of
Huntingdon and Cambridge. To Hugh Bigot (for his seruice) he gaue the
castell of Norwhich. All these gifts and grants (with diuerse other to
other persons) promised &amp; granted, he confirmed with his new seale,
which the king of France had caused him to make. These things being thus
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i><a name="FNanchor_5_4" id="FNanchor_5_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
ordered at Paris, euerie man resorted to his charge, that he might
prouide for the warre with all sp&eacute;ed conuenient.</p>

<p>King Henrie the father aduertised of this new league of the conspirators
against him, was in great perplexitie of mind, for that he saw himselfe
in danger, not onelie of outward enimies, but also of his owne subiects
at home. Yet bicause the winter season was alreadie at hand, taking
awaie all conuenient occasions of attempting any great exploit by war
for that time, he was in hope to compasse some agr&eacute;ement with his sons
yer the spring of the yeare should returne, and therefore he made not so
great prouision for his defense, as had b&eacute;ene necessarie in so dangerous
a case. But the Frenchmen who were bent to set forward this war with all
diligence, were readie in the field immediatlie vpon the comming of the
<span class="rightnote">The confederats inuade the dominions of king Henrie the
father.</span>
spring with king Henrie the sonne, and euen at one instant made their
inuasions vpon the lands of king Henrie the father in three seuerall
parties; namelie, in Normandie, Guien, and Britaine, which (against the
will of his sonne Geffrey duke thereof) king Henrie the father did hold
and reteine in his owne hands. The Frenchmen thus inuading the foresaid
countries, did much hurt with robbing and spoiling, and also tooke
diuerse castels and townes.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The king of Scots inuadeth Cumberland.</span>
Moreouer about the same time, William king of Scotland entred with a
great power, first into Cumberland, and besieged Carleil: but hearing
that an armie was prepared
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
against him in the south parties of the
realme, and readie to set forward, he raised his siege, and entred into
Northumberland (which prouince king Henrie the sonne had giuen him in
the last assemblie holden at Paris) endeuouring to bring it into his
possession. But the more earnestlie he went about to inforce the people
to his will, the more stiflie did they withstand his purpose, hating him
so much, that in no condition they were willing to come vnder his rule,
whereby the Scots were put backe and repelled, and that to their great
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
losse. The kings power also comming into the countrie followed them, and
passing ouer the water of Tweed, which diuided then (as it dooth at this
daie) the two realmes, made the like spoile in the land of the enimies,
as they had made in the countries of Northumberland and Cumberland.</p>

<p>But in Normandie, whilest others in other places, made their hand in
fetching preies and booties out of the enimies countrie, king Lewes
<span class="rightnote">Vernueil besieged. <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> Hugh Beauchampe.</span>
besieged Vernueil, which towne being strong of it selfe, Hugh Beauchampe
and others that had charge thereof valientlie defended, so that the
French<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> king was a moneth before it, yer he could win anie part thereof.
This towne of Vernueil was in those daies diuided into three portions,
beside the castell, euerie of them apart from other with mightie wals
and d&eacute;epe ditches full of water. One of these parts was called the great
Burrow without the wals, where the French king had pitcht his field &amp;
planted his engins. About a moneth after whose coming thither, vittels
began to faile them within, so that at length they required a truce
onelie for thr&eacute;e daies, &amp; if no succour came within those thr&eacute;e daies,
they promised to yeeld that part of the towne called the great Burrow, &amp;
the peremptorie daie was the vigill or eeue of S. Laurence. Herevpon
were hostages deliuered by the burgesses vnto the French king. Now it
was agr&eacute;ed that if they y&eacute;elded the towne at the daie appointed for want
of succor, king Henrie the son, and Robert the French kings brother,
with the earles of Trois &amp; Blois, Henrie and Theobald, and William
archbish. of Sens, vndertooke vpon their othes that the hostages should
then be restored free &amp; without any hurt or damage.</p>

<p>King Henrie being certified from them within of the composition thus
made, was driuen to a verie hard shift: for he doubted nothing lesse
than that any such thing should haue chanced. Yet considering with
himselfe, that the sauing of the towne stood in his speedie comming to
the rescue, he hasted thither without any staie, and came to the place
the daie before the third and last daie of the truce. King Lewes
<span class="rightnote">The French king requireth to talke.</span>
perceiuing him to be come, doubting least he should loose the preie
which he looked for, sent vnto the king, and required that he might
common with him on the next daie, touching some means of agr&eacute;ement to be
had betwixt him and his sons. This did he of policie, to f&eacute;ed him with
hope of some end to be made in the troubles betwixt him and his sons,
till he had gotten possession of the towne.</p>

<p>Now as he forecast that matter, euen so it came to passe, for whilest a
great p&eacute;ece of the next daie was spent in feined talke about an
agr&eacute;ement; K. Lewes appointed a great part of his host to close the
towne about, and to declare vnto them within, that king Henrie was put
to flight; which talke they within Vernueil bel&eacute;euing, y&eacute;elded the towne
&amp; themselues to the Frenchmen. Soone after, king Lewes mistrusting least
he should not be able to k&eacute;epe it, set it on fire, and so burnt it,
contrarie to the composition betwixt him and them agr&eacute;ed and concluded
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The ninth of August being thursdaie saieth
<i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> king Lewes fl&eacute;eth awaie in the night.</span>
vpon. He kept also the souldiers that had yeelded it into his hands,
togither with the hostages as prisoners, and doubting to cope with his
enimie, went awaie in the night with as still noise as was possible.
Which euill dealing had not inuaded his hart, but that euill meaning had
possessed it before, euen at the composition making: but he neuer
learned that,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="rightnote"><i>Pub.&nbsp;Mim.</i></span>
<span class="i0">Fidem qui perdit nihil potest vltra perdere.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>King Henrie at length perceiuing the fraud, sent certeine bands of his
horssemen after to persue the enimie: but for that king Lewes was
alreadie gotten into the inner parts of his owne countrie, those which
were sent, turned vpon those that were left in the hindermost ward, of
whome they slue a great number both horssemen and footmen.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
K. Henrie following his men, came to Vernueil, and staieng there that
night, tooke order for the repairing and new fortifieng of the towne. On
the morrow after he went to the castell of Danuille, and wan it, taking
diuerse knights and yeomen within it: this castell belonged to one
<span class="rightnote">Danuille. Gilbert de Tileres.</span>
Gilbert de Tileres. And thus it came to passe touching the attempt of
the French king for the winning of Vernueil, as in some authors we find
reported. &para;&nbsp;Other write otherwise of the mater, as thus, the French K.

being summoned by K. Henrie the father, either to depart from the seige
of Vernueil or to looke for battell; &amp; hearing also that in performance
of the message K. Hearie approched with his power, he sent a bishop &amp; an
abbat vnto him to vnderstand if he meant to giue battell in deed. The
messengers met king Henrie as he was aduanced before his host vpon some
<span class="rightnote">K. Henrie his short answere to the French kings messengers.</span>
occasion with a small companie about him, vnto whome they declared that
their maister the French king, required to be assured whether he should
haue battell or no. King Henrie armed as he was, with fierce countenance
and dreadfull voice made this short answere; "Get you hence, and tell
your king that I am here at hand." The messengers returning to their
maister, declared what they had s&eacute;ene and heard. Wherevpon (without
longer staie) he raised his field, and with a gallant and mightie armie
departed home to his great dishonour, not winning the towne at all, as
by the same author it should appeere.</p>

<p>About the same time the earle of Flanders, one of the confederats
besieged the towne of Albemarle, and the earle therof within it, which
<span class="rightnote">Albemarle woon by the earle of Flanders.</span>
earle was thought to betraie the towne, bicause it was so easilie woone,
and both he himselfe, and those which king Henrie the father had sent
thither to defend the towne were taken prisoners. Diuerse other places
which belonged to the same earle were also immediatlie deliuered into
the enimies hands, which increased the suspicion.</p>

<p>After this towne of Newcastell (otherwise called Drincourt) in those
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Ia.&nbsp;Meir.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i>
The earle of Bullongne wounded, and dieth.</span>
frontiers was besieged, and finallie woone by surrender, by the said
earle of Flanders, who reioised nothing at the gaine of that towne: for
his brother Matthew; the earle of Bullongne who should haue b&eacute;ene his
heire, was shot into the kn&eacute;e with an arrow, as he approched to the
wals, and died of the hurt within a few daies after. The earle of
Flanders was so pensife for his brothers death, that he brake vp his
iournie and returned, blaming his euill hap and follie in that he had
attempted war against his coosen germane king Henrie, who neuer had
harmed him, but rather had doone him manie great and singular pleasures
from time to time.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Good cause had the earle to giue ouer the prosequuting of violence
against<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> his souereigne, being dawnted with so heauie a chance, &amp; griped
also with the grudge of conscience, in so vnkindlie rewarding his
welwiller, at whose hands he confessed himselfe to haue receiued manie a
benefit. Wherein we are to note, that ingratitude neuer hurteth anie so
much as him or them in whom it is nestled. And hereto alludeth the
comedie-writer, when he saith verie neatlie,</p>

<p>Moreouer Henrie the elder (after the iournie of Vernueil ended) came
backe to Rouen, and there vnderstanding that Hugh earle of Chester, and
Rafe de Foulgiers, men of singular prowesse (who long before were
reuolted to his sonne Henrie) had taken the castell of Dole in Britaine,
and there making warre, brought all the countrie into trouble, he sent
foorth streightwaies certeine of his capteines with the Brabanders to
aid his people in those parts who on the twentieth day of August (being
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
monday) encountring with the enimies, discomfited them in battell, tooke
seauenteene knights, beside diuerse others both horssemen and footmen,
slue aboue fifteene hundred of the enimies being Britaines, and pursuing
the residue, entred the towne which they wan, and droue their
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
aduersaries into the castell, where they besieged them, and with all
sp&eacute;ed aduertised the king of that enterprise, who immediatlie with all
possible hast came thither, applieng his whole diligence to win the
place, that he might haue them which were within the same at his
commandement.</p>

<p>To be short, it was not long yer he had his desire, for being such a
multitude, that they were not able long to continue within so streict a
roome, for want of vittell they fell to a composition, yeelding the
castell vnto the king, their bodies, liues, and lims saued, on the 25.
day of August. There were within this castell 80. knights, besides
yeomen and other common souldiers. In like maner, and with the semblable
good fortune, about the same time, his capteins in England ouercame his
enimies: for whereas Robert earle of Leicester that tooke part with king
Henrie the sonne, had assembled at the towne of Leicester a great host
of men, in purpose to set vpon Reignold earle of Cornewall and Richard
Lucie capteines on the side of king Henrie the father: they
vnderstanding his meaning, marched streight towards Leicester, and by
the waie met with their enimie earle Robert, whome they so fiercelie
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Leicester put to flight.</span>
assailed, that they put him to flight, and after approching the towne,
had it surrendered vnto them, permitting the inhabitants to depart with
bag and baggage, and then burned the towne: but the castell (which in
those daies was of great strength by reason of the situation) they could
not win.</p>

<p>Howbeit some write, that by vndermining, the walles of the towne were
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Leicester won by force.</span>
subuerted and throwne downe, so that the towne was entred by force,
although they within withdrew themselues into the castell and other
strong houses, which they defended for a time, till at length they
surrendered all, one parcell of the castell excepted, for the which by
composition they paied by way of a fine the sum of thr&eacute;e hundred pounds
to the vse of K. Henrie the father. The siege began the seauenth day of
Julie, and on the 28. day of the same moneth the armie departed from
thence, a truce being granted to those that still defended a certeine
tower of the castell into the which they were withdrawne.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The king of Scots inuadeth Northumberland.</span>
William also the Scotish king, with an armie of Scots and Gallowaimen
inuaded Northumberland, and passing by the confines of the bishoprike of
Durham, did much hurt by slaughter, burning and spoiling the countrie.
Neuerthelesse, hearing of a power raised by the English lords in those
<span class="rightnote">He retireth.</span>
parts to resist him, he withdrew into his countrie. The English armie
folowing him, wasted the countrie of Louthian,
<span class="rightnote">The English spoile Louthian. A truce.</span>
till at length by
mediation of certeine religious men, a truce was granted to the Scots to
indure till the feast of S. Hilarie. For the which truce happilie some
rewards went betwixt, and so the English lords with spoiles and gaines
returned homewards.</p>

<p>A few daies after these luckie chances thus happening to king Henrie,
king Lewes perceiuing fortune to be on that side, determined to assaie
whether he could obteine his purpose by some means of treatie, or at the
least put king Henrie in hope of a peace for a time, knowing that he
would rather suffer all discommodities whatsoeuer, than once to trie the
matter by battell with his sonnes: wherefore he offered to come to a
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> A treatie of peace.</span>
communication with him betwixt Gisors and Trie, shewing bread in the one
hand (as they say) and hiding a stone in the other.</p>

<p>King Henrie was easilie intreated to heare of anie talke for peace, and
therefore comming to the place on tuesdaie the fift&eacute;enth daie of
September, made so large offers, that he had almost conuerted the yoong
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The offer of K. Henrie the father to his
sonnes.</span>
mens minds vnto concord. First he offered to his sonne Henrie the yoong
king, the moitie or one halfe of all the reuenues belonging to the
demaines of the crowne within England, and four conuenient castels
within the same. Or if his sonne had rather remaine in Normandie, he
offered the halfe of all the reuenues of that dutchie, with all the
rents and profits that were his fathers perteining to the earledome of
Aniou, with certeine castels in Normandie, one castell in Aniou, one in
Maine, and one in Towraine. To his sonne Richard, he offered halfe the
reuenues
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
of Guien, and foure conuenient castels in the same. And to his
sonne Geffrey he offered all those lands that belonged by right of
inheritance vnto the daughter of Conan earle of Britaine, if he might by
the popes good licence marrie hir. And further king Henrie the father
y&eacute;elded himselfe to stand to the order of the archbishop of Tharent and
other the popes legats, not refusing to giue his sonnes what rents and
reuenues soeuer they should say were reasonable, reseruing onelie to
himselfe the administration of iustice, and the power roiall.</p>

<p>These s&eacute;emed to be large offers, but yet they could not be accepted. For
certeine sonnes of Beliall, set vpon nothing but misch&eacute;efe, troublers of
common peace and quietnesse, wrought so with them, that no conditions of
peace (were the same neuer so reasonable) could content them, so that
without effect this communication brake vp, but not without contumelious
words passed betwixt the parties, insomuch that the earle of Leicester
(who being put from all his aid in England, was come ouer to the French
king to purchase aid at his hands) could not refraine but giuing credit
to the old adage,</p>

<p>On the morrow after, the French and English skirmished togither betwixt
Curseils and Gisors, in which conflict Enguerane Chastillone de Trie was
taken prisoner by earle William de Mandeuille, who presented him to the
king of England. King Lewes though he iudged it his part to preserue his
sonne in law from danger, yet he ment nothing lesse than to ioin battell
with the English at that present. But within a few daies after, he sent
Robert earle of Leicester into England with an armie of Flemings and
others, there to ioine with Hugh Bigot, that both of them might as well
by force as faire promises and gentle persuasions bring the whole realme
vnto the obedience of king Henrie the sonne.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Additions to <i>Iohn&nbsp;Pike.</i></span>
The earle of Leicester therefore landing at Walton the 21. of September,
passed through the countrie vnto Fremingham, where he was receiued of
Hugh Bigot earle of Northfolke; and after that an other fl&eacute;et of
Flemings were arriued for their aid, they went vnto Gipswich, where when
they had remained a few daies, and augmented their forces by certeine
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
bands of men of warre that belonged vnto earle Bigot, they went to the
castell of Haghenet (that belonged vnto Ranulph Broc) which they tooke,
spoiled &amp; burned, &amp; then returned to Fremingham.</p>

<p>After this, hearing that the countesse of Leicester was arriued at
Orreford with an other power of Flemings, they went to m&eacute;et hir: and so
the earle of Leicester, hauing now a strong armie about him, tooke leaue
of earle Bigot, and ment to passe through the countrie into
Leicestershire, there to succour his freends, and to worke some feat for
the behoofe and furtherance of their quarell.</p>

<p>In the meane time the arriuall of the earle of Leicester being knowne,
the people of the countrie were assembled togither. Also Richard Lucie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
lord cheefe iustice, and Humfrey de Boun high conestable of England,
with the kings power of horssemen which latelie before had b&eacute;ene in
Scotland, and made inrodes there (as before is mentioned) came with all
sp&eacute;ed to saue the countrie from spoile, hauing first taken a truce (as
before is said) with the king of Scots, till the feast of Saint Hilarie
next ensuing (or rather Ester) hostages being deliuered on both sides.
Vpon knowledge then had where the enimies were lodged, and what they
intended to doo, the said Richard Lucie &amp; Humfrey de Boun came to Saint
Edmundsburie, whither Reignold earle of Cornewall the kings vncle,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Robert earle of Glocester, and William erle of Arundell resorted.</p>

<p>In the meane while, the earle of Leicester passed forward on his waie so
farre as Fornham
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
a little village beside S. Edmundsburie. The lord
ch&eacute;efe iustice &amp; the earls before mentioned with a great armie, and
amongst others the said Humfrey de Boun, who had the leading of 300.
knights, or men of armes at the kings wages, came out of S.
Edmundsburie, hauing the baner of S. Edmund borne before them, &amp; in a
marish ground betwixt Fornham &amp; Edmunsburie, they encountred with the
said earle of Leicester, and after long and cruell fight discomfited his
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Leicester taken prisoner.</span>
people, and tooke him prisoner, togither with his wife the countesse
Petronill, after he had doone all that belonged to a valiant capteine.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
Some write that there were killed on that day of his people to the
number of ten thousand [and almost as manie taken] verelie [all the
footmen of the Flemings being in number foure or fiue thousand were
either taken or slaine:] the residue that escaped fled towards
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
Leicester, that they might both defend the towne &amp; themselues from the
danger of their foes.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;But here is to be noted, that it s&eacute;emeth by the report of some
writers, how the earle of Leicester had not so great an armie there at
that battell, as by others account of the number slaine and taken it
should appeare he had. For at his departure from his companion in armes
Hugh Bigot, he tooke vpon him to passe through the countrie (as some
write) partlie vpon trust that he had of the force and number of his
souldiers, being about foure or fiue thousand stout and valiant footmen,
besides 80 chosen and well appointed horssemen; and partlie in hope that
manie of those which were in his aduersaries campe, would rather turne
to him than fight against him.</p>

<p>He had a great confidence in the Flemings, who ind&eacute;ed presumed much vpon
their owne strength, so that they made account of some great conquest,
in such wise, that when they came into any large plaine where they might
rest, they would take ech others by the hand, and leading a danse, sing
in their countrie language,</p>

<p>King Henrie receiuing aduertisement of the victorie which his capteines
had thus gotten in England, was maruellous ioifull, and commanded that
the prisoners should be brought ouer vnto him into Normandie: which
being doone, he went into Aniou, and there fortified the towns and
castels of the countrie with sure garrisons of men, to resist all sudden
inuasion, secret practises, and other attempts of the enimies. On the
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The towne of Vandosme woone.</span>
feast of S. Andrew the apostle, he tooke the towne of Vandosme by force,
which Buchard de Lauerdin held against him, hauing first expelled his

<p>About this season, or rather somewhat before, king Henrie the father,
(contrarie to the prohibition of the king his sonne and after the
<span class="rightnote">S&eacute;e <a href="#Letter1">his letter</a> before in page <a href="#Page_147">147</a>.<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>

the bishoprike of Winchester; to Robert Foliot the bishoprike of
Hereford; to Geffrey Ridell archdeacon of Canturburie he gaue the

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> *&nbsp;Which was fought on the 17. of October</span>
But now to our purpose. The nobles of the realme of England (after the *
battell of of S. Edmundsburie) with an infinit number of men went
against Hugh Bigot in purpose to abate his pride. But whereas they might
easilie haue had him at their pleasure, by meanes of such summes of
monie as he gaue in bribes, a peace was granted to him till Whitsuntide,
within which time hauing gotten togither fourteene thousand Flemings, he
passed through Essex, and so getting ouer into Kent, came to Douer,
where he tooke ship and transported ouer into France.</p>

King Henrie the father held his Christmasse this yeare at Caen in
Normandie, about which time a truce was made betwixt him and king Lewes
to endure till Easter, or (as others write) for the terme of six
moneths. For ye haue to vnderstand, that the fame of the victorie gotten
by the capteines of king Henrie the father against the earle of
Leicester
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
(being not onlie spred through England, but also blown ouer
into France) put those that tooke part with him in great feare; but
speciallie king Lewes mistrusting the matter began to wax wearie that he
had attempted so far, and susteined so great trauell and expenses in
another mans cause.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
Whilest this truce indured, the archbishop of Canturburie being readie
to returne home in dispaire of his businesse, vpon a feigned rumor spred
that there was a peace concluded betwixt the two kings, the father and
sonne, he was called backe and consecrated by the pope the sundaie after
Easter: and then furnished with the dignities of primat and legat of
England, and other priuileges according, he tooke his waie homewards
towards England, after he had laid foorth great summes of monie to
disappoint the purposes of his aduersaries.</p>

<p>This yeare in June, the lord Geffrey the elect of Lincolne the kings
sonne besieged the castell which Roger de Mowbry had repaired at Kinard
Ferie, within the Isle of Oxholme, and compelling the souldiers within
to y&eacute;eld, he beat downe and raced the same castell vnto the verie
ground. Robert Mowbray conestable of that castell, as he passed thorough<a name="FNanchor_5_8" id="FNanchor_5_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
the countrie towards Leicester, there to procure some aid, was taken by
the men of Claie, and kept as prisoner. Moreouer, the said elect of
Lincolne tooke the castell of Malesert that belonged to the said Roger
Mowbray, which being now taken, was deliuered vnto the keeping of the
archbishop of Yorke. The said elect also fortified a castell at
Topclife, and tooke it to the k&eacute;eping of William Stuteuille. In this
meane while the king tooke the strengths, and fortresses which his sonne
Richard had fortified at Xanctes, and in the same forts and church
(which was also fortified against him) 60. knights or men of armes, and
400. archbalisters, that is, the best of them that bare crossebowes.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The oth of the earle of Flanders.</span>
Philip earle of Flanders in the presence of the French king and other
the peeres of France, laieng his hand vpon the holie relikes, sware that
within 15. daies next insuing the feast of S. John then instant to enter
England with an armie, and to doo his best to subdue the same to king
Henrie the son. Vpon trust whereof the yoong king the more presuming
<span class="rightnote">Additions to <i>Iohn&nbsp;Pike.</i></span>
came downe to Whitsand, the 14. daie of Julie, that he might from thence
send ouer into England Rafe de la Haie with certeine bands of souldiers.
Before this the earle of Flanders had sent ouer 318. knights or men of
armes, as we may call them. But after their arriuall at Orwell, which
chanced the 14. of June, by reason that there associats were dispersed,
and for the more part subdued, they tooke with them earle Hugh Bigot,
and marching to Norwich, assaulted the citie and wan it, gaining there
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
great riches, and speciallie in readie monie, and led awaie a great sort
of prisoners whome they ransomed at their pleasure. This chanced the 18.
of June.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;I remember that William Paruus writeth, that the citie of Norwich was
taken by the Flemings that came ouer with the earle of Leicester in the
yeare last past, by the conduct of the said earle before he was taken,
and that after he had taken that citie, being accompanied with earle
Bigot, he led those Flemings also vnto Dunwich, purposing to win and
sacke that towne also: but the inhabitants being better prouided against
the comming of their enimies than they of Norwich were, shewed such
countenance of defense, that they preserued their towne from that
danger, so that the two earles with Flemings were constreined to depart
without atchiuing their purpose. But whether that this attempt against
Dunwich was made by the earle of Leicester (before his taking) in
companie of earle Bigot, I haue not to auouch. But verilie for the
winning of Norwich, I suppose that William Paruus mistaketh the time,
except we shall saie that it was twise taken, as first by the earle of
Leicester in the yeare 1173. For it is certeine by consent of most
writers, and especiallie those that haue recorded particularlie the
incidents that chanced here in this land during these troubles betwixt
the king and his sons that it was taken now this yeare, 1174 by earle
Bigot (as before we haue shewed.)</p>

<p>But now to proc&eacute;ed. The lords that had the rule of the land for king
Henrie the
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
father, perceiuing earle Bigots proc&eacute;edings, sent knowledge
thereof with all expedition to the king, as yet remaining in the parties
beyond the seas. Whilest these things were a dooing, although the minds
of manie of the conspirators against king Henrie the father were
inclined to peace, yet Roger Mowbray, and Hugh Bigot (by reason of his
<span class="rightnote">Additions to <i>Iohn&nbsp;Pike.</i></span>
new supplie of men got out of Flanders) ceased not to attempt fresh
exploits: and ch&eacute;eflie they solicited the matter in such wise with
William king of Scotland, that whilest they in other quarters of the
realme plaied their parts, he entred into the confines of Cumberland,
<span class="rightnote">The king of Scots inuadeth England.</span>
and first besieged the citie of Carleil, but perceiuing he could not win
it in any short time, he left one part of his armie to keepe siege
before it, and with the residue marched into the countrie alongst by the
<span class="rightnote">Castels woon by the Scots.</span>
riuer of Eden, taking by force the castels of Bourgh and Applebie, with
diuerse other. This doone, he passed ouer the riuer, and came through
Northumberland (wasting the countrie as he went) vnto Alnewike, which
place he attempted to win, though his labour therein proued but in
vaine.</p>

<p>This enterprise which he made into Northumberland, he tooke in hand
ch&eacute;eflie at the suit and request of Roger Mowbray, from whome Geffrey
(who after was bishop of Lincolne) K. Henries eldest base son had taken
two of his castels, so that he kept the third with much adoo. He had
giuen his eldest sonne in hostage vnto the said king of Scots for
assurance of such couenants to be kept on his behalfe as were passed
betwixt them. In the meane time one Duncane or Rothland, with an other
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> Duncane a Scotish capteine wasteth Kendall.</span>
part of the Scotish armie entred into Kendall, and wasted that countrie
in most cruell wise, neither sparing age nor sex, insomuch that he brake
into the churches, slue those that were fled into the same for safegard
of their liues as well preests as other. The English power of horssemen

<p>These capteines hauing knowledge that Duncane was in one side of the

trie the chance of warre, (which is doubtfull and vncerteine, according
to the old saieng,</p>

<p class="nogap">against the enimies, sith it should be a great rebuke to them to suffer
the countrie to be wasted after that sort without reuengement. Herevpon
riding foorth one morning, there arose such a thicke fog and mist that
they could not discerne any waie about them, so that doubting to fall
within the laps of their enimies at vnwares, they staied a while to take
aduise what should be best for them to doo. Now when they were almost
fullie resolued to haue turned backe againe, by the comfortable words
<span class="rightnote">Bernard de Balliolle.</span>
and bold exhortation of Bernard Balliolle, they changed their purpose,
and rode forward, till at length the northerne wind began to waken, and
droue awaie the mist, so that the countrie was discouered vnto them, and
perceiuing where Alnewike stood, not knowing as yet whether the Scots
had woone it or not, they staied their pace, and riding softlie, at
length learning by the inhabitants of the countrie, that the Scotish
king desparing to win Alnewike, had raised his siege from thence the
same day, they turned streight thither, and lodging there all night, in
the morning got to their horsses verie earelie, riding foorth towards
the enimies that were spred abroad in the countrie to forey the same.
They had anon espied where the king was, and incontinentlie compassed
him about on euerie side, who perceiuing the English horssemen readie
thus to assaile him with all diligence called backe his men from the
spoile; but the more part of them being straied far off through the
sw&eacute;etnes they found in getting of preies, could not heare the sound of
the trumpets, yet notwithstanding with those his horssemen which he
could get togither, he encountred the English men which came vpon him
verie hastilie.</p>

<p>The battell was begun verie fiercelie at the first, and well fought for
a time, but the Scotish horssemen being toiled before in foreieng the
countrie, could not long continue against the fierce assault of the
English, but were either beaten downe, or else constreined
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
to saue
<span class="rightnote">The king of Scots taken.</span>
themselues by flight. The king with a few other (who at the first had
begun the battell) was taken. Also manie of the Scots that being far
off, and yet hearing of the skirmish, came running toward the place, &amp;
were taken yer they could vnderstand how the matter had passed. This
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
taking of the king of Scots was on a saturdaie, being the seuenth<a name="FNanchor_5_9" id="FNanchor_5_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of
Julie.</p>

<p>The English capteines hauing thus taken the Scotish king in the midst of
his armie, conteining the number of 80000 men, returned to Newcastell,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
greatlie reioising of their good successe, aduertising king Henrie the
father hereof with all speed, who as then was come ouer from Normandie,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
and was (the same day that the Scotish king was taken) at Canturburie,
making his praiers there before the sepulture of the archbishop Becket
(as after shall app&eacute;ere.)</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
In the meane while and somewhat before this time, the earle of
Leicesters men, which laie at Leicester vnder the conduct of Robert
Ferreis earle of Darbie (as some write) or rather of Anketille Malorie
constable or gouernour (if we shall so call him, as Roger Houeden saith)
came to Northampton, where they fought with them of that towne, and
<span class="rightnote">This chanced a little after Whitsuntide.</span>
getting the victorie, tooke two hundred prisoners, and slue or wounded
n&eacute;ere hand as manie more, and so with this good successe in that
enterprise returned againe to Leicester, from whence they first set
foorth. The kings horssemen herevpon came streight waies to Northampton,
and following the enimies, could not ouertake them.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Rob. Ferreis.</span>
Robert Ferreis earle of Darbie being now come vnto Leicester in aid of
them that laie there, staied not past ten daies: but finding meanes to
increase his number of horssemen, suddenlie made to Notingham, which
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <i>Reg.&nbsp;Houed.</i> Notingham taken.</span>
Reignold de Lucie had in k&eacute;eping, and comming thither earelie in the
morning tooke it, droue out the kings souldiers that laie there in
garison, burned the towne, slue the inhabitants, and diuided their goods
amongst his souldiers: which thing put the countrie about in such feare,
that manie of the inhabitants submitted themselues vnto him.</p>

<p>King Henrie the sonne being hereof aduertised by letters oftentimes sent
vnto him by this Robert Ferreis, and other his fr&eacute;ends here in England,
eftsoones conceiued some good hope to obteine his purpose: and therefore
determined to prepare for the warre. Herevpon he purchased aid of king
Lewes, who (bicause the truce which he had taken with king Henrie the
father was now expired) thought it was reason to further his sonne in
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
lawes enterprise so farre as in him laie. Wherfore he made his prouision
at Graueling, and there incamping with his people, staied till his ships
were readie to transport him and his armie, which consisted of certeine
horssemen, and of a number of Brabanders.</p>

<p>King Henrie the father being informed both of his sonnes purpose, and of
the dooings in England, with all possible sp&eacute;ed determined to passe ouer
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
into England, and therefore got his souldiers a shipboord, among whome
were certeine bands of Brabanders: and so soone as the wind blew to his
mind, he caused the sailes to be hoised vp, and the nauie to set
forward. Being landed, he repaired first vnto Canturburie, there to make
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
his praiers, doubting least the bloud of the archbishop Thomas Becket
being shed through his occasion, did yet require vengeance against him
for that fact. From Canturburie he came to London, and tooke order for
the placing of capteines with their bands in certeine townes about the
coast, to defend the landing places, where he thought his sonne was like
<span class="rightnote">Huntington castell woone.</span>
to arriue. Then went he to Huntington, and subdued the castell there the
19. of Julie: for the knights and other souldiers that were within it
y&eacute;elded themselues to the kings mercie, their liues and lims saued.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
After this, assembling his people on all sides, he made his generall
musters at S. Edmundsburie, and determined to besiege the castels of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Earle Bigot is accorded with the K.</span>
Bunghey and Fremingham, which the earle Hugh Bigot held against him, who
mistrusting that he was not able to defend himselfe and those places
against the king, agr&eacute;ed with the king to haue peace, paieng him the
summe of a thousand markes by composition. This agr&eacute;ement was
concluded
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
the 25. of Julie. Herevpon a multitude of the Flemings which Philip
<span class="rightnote">The Flemings sent home.</span>
earle of Flanders had sent into England (as before is mentioned) vpon
their oth receiued, not afterwards to come as enimies into England, had
licence to returne into their countrie. Also the bands of souldiers that
came into the realme with Rafe de la Haie departed without impediment by
the kings sufferance.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
The king hauing thus accomplished that which stood with his pleasure in
those parties, remoued from thence and drew towards Northampton. To
<span class="rightnote">The king of Scots presented to the King of England.</span>
which towne after his comming thither, the king of Scots was brought
with his f&eacute;et bound vnder the horsses bellie. Thither also came the
bishop of Durham, and deliuered to the king the castels of Durham,
Norham, and Allerton. Thither also came to the king Roger Mowbraie, and
surrendred to him the castell of Treske, and Robert earle Ferreis
deliuered vp into his hands the castels of Tutburie, and Duffield, and
Anketill Mallorie, and William de Diue constables to the earle of
Leicester yeelded to the king the castels of Cicester, Grobie, and
Mountsorell, to the intent that he should deale more courteouslie with
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Glocester. The earle Richard of Clare.</span>
the earle their maister. Also William earle of Glocester, and earle
Richard of Clare submitted themselues to the king, and so he brought all
his aduersaries within the realme of England vnto such subiection as he
himselfe wished; so that the king hauing atchiued the vpper hand of his
enimies returned to London.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;All this hurlie burlie and bloudie tumult, was partlie to be ascribed
to the king himselfe, who ouer tenderlie fauouring his sonne, did deiect
and abase himselfe to aduance the other; partlie to the ambitious
disposition of the youth, who was charged with roialtie, before he had
learned sufficient loialtie, else would he not haue made insurrections
against his father, that himself might obteine the monarchie, and the
old king doo him homage: and partlie to the qu&eacute;enes discontented or
rather malicious mind, whose dutie it had b&eacute;ene (notwithstanding such
dishonour doone hir by the king in abusing his bodie vnlawfullie) so
little to haue thought of stirring commotions betwixt the father and the
sonnes that she should rather haue lulled the contention asl&eacute;epe, and
doone what she possiblie could to quench the feruent fier of strife with
the water of pacification. But true it is that hath b&eacute;ene said long ago,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="rightnote"><i>Pub.&nbsp;Mim.</i></span>
<span class="i0">Mulier nihil nouit nisi quod vult,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et plenum malorum est onus.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But what insued herevpon euen by waie of chastisement, but that which
commonlie lighteth vpon tumult-raisers; namelie, either losse of life,
or at least restraint of libertie? For the king after this happie
atchiuement of his warlike affaires, being ruled by reason and aduise
(as it is likelie) would not that so smoking a fierbrand (as qu&eacute;ene
<span class="rightnote">Qu&eacute;ene Elinor is committed to close prison.</span>
Elianor had prooued hirselfe to be) should still annoie his eies, and
therefore (whether in angrie or quiet mood, that is doubtfull) he
committed hir to close prison, bicause she had procured his sons Richard
and Geffrey to ioine with their elder brother against him their father
(as before ye haue partlie heard.)</p>

<p>But to proc&eacute;ed, king Lewes being aduertised that there was no great
number of men of war left in Normandie to defend the countrie, raised a
power, and comming to Rouen, besieged it verie streitlie. Shortlie after
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
also king Henrie the sonne and Philip earle of Flanders came thither,
meaning to obteine the possession of Normandie first, and after to go
<span class="rightnote">Rouen besieged by the Fr&#275;ch king. <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
into England. The citizens of Rouen perceiuing in what danger they
stood, without out faint harts prepared all things necessarie for
defense, and did euerie thing in order, purposing not to giue ouer their
citie for any threats or menaces of their enimies. Now whilest they
within were busie in deuising how to repell the assault, and to defend
themselues, the aduersaries about midnight came forth of their campe,
and approching the walles with their ladders, raised them vp, and began
to scale the citie. But the citizens being aduised thereof, boldlie got
them to the loops and towers, ouerthrew the ladders of the enimies that
were comming vp, and with arrowes, stones and darts beat them backe, to
their great losse and ouerthrow. Howbeit though the enimies could not
preuaile thus
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
to get the citie by this assault, yet they continued the
siege, and suffered not them with it to be in quiet, but daie and night
assailed them by one meanes or other.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> King Henrie returneth into Normandie.</span>
King Henrie the father being aduertised h&eacute;ereof, after he had set his
businesse in order, touching the suertie and safe defense of the English
estate, he returned into Normandie and landed at Harfleet on a thursdaie
being the eight daie of August, bringing backe againe with him his
Brabanders, and a thousand Welshmen. In this meane while, king Lewes
continued still his siege before Rouen, constreining them within by all
meanes he could deuise to yeeld vp their citie. At length came the feast
of Saint Laurence, on which daie the French king commanded that no man
should attempt any enterprise against the citizens, granting them truce
for that day, in worship of that saint. This truce was so acceptable a
thing to them within, that they forgetting themselues, without all
respect to the danger wherein the citie stood, threw off their armour,
and gaue themselues to sl&eacute;epe and rest. Some also fell to banketting and
other pastimes in verie dissolute maner.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;But through this their remisse vsage and loose behauiour, and
forgetting that a temporarie truce is no safe warrant of securitie and
peace, they deriued danger and destruction to themselues; which it had
beene their parts prouidentlie to haue preuented, and not through their
carelesnesse to set open a gap of aduantage to their enimies, who
pursued them with professed hostilitie, notwithstanding they reposed
confidence in the truce that was granted. H&eacute;erein they are to be
resembled to the cooks of whome Plautus speaketh verie neatlie, saieng,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash; coquos equidem nimis<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="nogap">Meaning sobrietie: so these delighting more in their dishes, than
mistrusting their enimies, remembred to take the vse of any pleasure
that the conuenientnesse of this present time might proffer; onelie as
cookes among all their sawces doo mind nothing lesse than sobernesse: so
these in the abundance of their ioies, thought nothing of after claps,
which afterwards made them (like fooles) to sing an vnhappie had I wist.
For the Frenchmen, perceiuing this their negligence, required licence of
the French king to giue assault to the citie, declaring in what state
the matter presentlie stood; who not meaning to violate the reuerence of
that day, and his promised faith, with any such vnlawfull attempt,
commanded his men of warre that made the request in no wise to stirre.
<span class="rightnote">The Frenchmen assault the citie, without commandement of
their king.</span>
Howbeit the souldiers vpon couetousnesse of the spoile, raised the
ladders to that part of the wall which they iudged to be most without
warders, so that some of them mounting aloft, got vp, and were about to
help vp their fellowes.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Two pr&eacute;ests.</span>
Now it happened (as God would haue it) that two pr&eacute;ests being gone vp
into the steeple of the cheefe church, to looke about them for their
pleasures, fortuned to s&eacute;e where the French men were about to enter the
citie, and streightwaies gaue knowledge to the citizens beneath.
Wherevpon the alarum rose, insomuch that with all sp&eacute;ed the people ran
<span class="rightnote">The Frenchmen are repelled.</span>
to the place, and with such violence came vpon their enimies which were
entred vpon the walles, that streightwaies they slue manie of them, and
chased the residue out of the ditches, so that they returned with
bleeding wounds to their campe, repenting them of their vnhappie
enterprise, that turned them to such wo and greeuance.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
The same day a little before night, king Henrie the father came vnto
Rouen, and was receiued into the citie with great ioy and gladnesse: for
he came thither by chance, euen about the time that the citie had thus
like to haue bin surprised &amp; taken at vnwares.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
&para;&nbsp;There be that write, how the French king (immediatlie vpon the
arriuall of king Henrie) left his field and departed, greatlie to his
dishonor, burning vp his engines of warre, and not staieng till his men
might haue leisure to charge their wagons with their armor and other
stuffe, which they were glad to leaue behind for a prey to the English
men
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
issuing foorth vpon them. But other declare, that the French king
being nothing abashed of king Henries comming, continued the siege, in
hope to win the citie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The Welshmens good seruice.</span>
The next day earlie in the morning (or as other say in the night season)
the king did send foorth a certeine number of Welshmen to passe ouer the
riuer of Saine, which they did, and by force made themselues waie
through the French campe, getting without losse or danger vnto a great
wood, and slue that day of their aduersaries aboue an hundred men. After
<span class="rightnote"><i>Nic.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
this, lieng abroad in the countrie, they skirmished dailie with the
French horssemen, and oft times cut of such prouision of vittels as came
to nourish the campe. The king himselfe on the other side remaining
within the citie, caused his people to issue out at the gates, and to
k&eacute;epe the enimies occupied with skirmishes afore the citie. And
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
moreouer, where there was a great trench cast betwixt the French campe
and the walles of the citie, he caused the same to be filled vp with
fagots, stores, and earth. But although the French men sawe this the
kings deed well enough, yet none of them issued foorth of their tents to
hinder the English of their purpose.</p>

<p>Now king Lewes being sore vexed with his enimies on ech side, and
perceiuing the citie would not be woone within any short time, began to
wax wearie, and to repent himselfe (as afore) for taking in hand so
chargeable and great a warre for another mans quarell. Wherevpon he
<span class="rightnote">The French king maketh an ouerture for peace.</span>
caused William bishop of Sens, and Theobald earle of Blois to go to king
Henrie, and to promise vpon forbearance from warre for a time, to find
means to reconcile him and his sonnes, betweene whom vnnaturall variance
rested. Whereof K. Henrie being most desirous, and taking a truce,
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> A truce.</span>
appointed to come to Gisors [in the feast of the natiuitie of our ladie]
there to meet king Lewes, that they might talke of the matter and bring
it to some good end.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The French king leaueth his siege.</span>
The French king, so soone as he knew that truce was taken, raised his
siege, and returning home, within a few daies after (according to the
appointment) came to Gisors, and there communed with king Henrie: but
bicause he could not make any agr&eacute;ement betwixt him and his sonnes at
that time, he appointed another time to meet about it. King Henrie the
father (whilest the truce continued with the French king) and his sonne
Henrie went to Poictou, where his sonne Richard (whilest his father had
beene occupied in other places) had gotten the most part of the countrie
into his possession. But now hearing of his comming, and that a truce
was taken with the French king and with his brother, he considered with
himselfe, that without their assistance he was not able to withstand his
<span class="rightnote">Richard the kings sonne prepareth to resist his father.</span>
fathers power. Howbeit at length choosing rather to trie the matter with
force of armes, than cowardlie to y&eacute;eld, he prepared for defense,
furnishing diuerse townes and castels with garisons of men: and
assembling togither all the other power that he was able to make, came
into the field, &amp; pitched his tents not far off from his father. In the
meane while, which way soeuer his father passed, the townes and castels
<span class="rightnote">He beginneth to dispaire of good successe.</span>
submitted themselues vnto him, so that Richard began to despaire of the
matter, insomuch that he durst not approch n&eacute;ere his father, but kept
aloofe, doubting to be entrapped.</p>

<p>At length when he had considered his owne state, and weied how
vnthankefullie the French king and his brother had dealt with him, in
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
hauing no consideration of him at such time as they tooke truce, he
determined to alter his purpose, and hauing some good hope in his
fathers clemencie, thought best to trie it, which he found to be the
best waie that he could haue taken. For oftentimes it chanceth, that
latter thoughts are better aduised than the first, as the old saieng is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Herevpon Richard laieng armour aside, came of his owne accord vnto his
<span class="rightnote">The son submitteth himselfe to the father.</span>
father on the 21. of September, and asked pardon. His father most
courteously receiuing him, made so much of him as though he had not
offended at all. Which example of courtesie preuailed much to the
alluring of his other sons to come to a reconciliation. For the bringing
whereof to speedie effect, he sent this Richard vnto king Lewes, and to
his other sonne Henrie, to commen with them of peace, at which time
earle Richard did so
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
effectuallie his message, that he brought them
both in good forwardnesse to agree to his fathers purpose, so that there
was a daie appointed for them to meet with their father, betwixt Towres
in Touraine and Ambois.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> The father &amp; sonnes are accorded.</span>
King Henrie reioising hereat, kept his daie (being the morrow after the
feast of S. Michaell) and there met him both king Lewes, and his two
sonnes Henrie and Geffrey, where finallie the father and the sonnes were
accorded; he promising to receiue them into fauour vpon these
conditions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The conditions of the agr&eacute;ement.</span>
1 First the prisoners to be released fr&eacute;elie without ransome on both
sides, and their offenses, which had taken either the one part or the
other, to be likewise pardoned.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
2 Out of this article were excepted all those which before the
concluding of this peace had alreadie compounded for their raunsomes, as
the king of Scots, the earles of Leicester and Chester, and Rafe
Fulgiers, with their pledges.</p>

<p>3 It was also agr&eacute;ed that all those castels which had beene builded in
time of this warre, should be raced and throwne downe, and all such
cities, townes, castels, countries and places, as had beene woone by
either part during these wars, should be restored vnto those persons
that held the same, and were in possession of them 15. daies before the
departure of the sonnes from king Henrie the father.</p>

<p>4 That king Henrie the father should assigne to his sons more large
reuenues for maintenance of their estates, with a caution included, that
they should not spend the same riotouslie in any prodigall sort or
maner.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
5 To the king his sonne, he gaue two castels in Normandie, with an
increase of yearelie reuenues, to the summe of 15. thousand pounds
Aniouin.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Richard.</span>
6 To his sonne Richard he gaue two houses in Poictou, with the one halfe
of all the reuenues of the countie of Poictou to be receiued and taken
in readie monie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Geffrey.</span>
7 And to his sonne Geffrey he granted in monie, the moietie of that
which he should haue by the mariage of earle Conans daughter, and after
he had maried hir by licence purchased of the pope, he should enioy all
the whole liuings and reuenues that descended to hir, as in hir fathers
writing thereof more at large was conteined.</p>

<p>8 On the other part, king Henrie the son couenanted to &amp; with the king
his father, that he would performe and confirme all those gifts, which
his father should grant out of his lands, &amp; also all those gifts of
lands which he either had made and assured, or hereafter should make and
assure vnto any of his men for any of their seruices: &amp; likewise those
<span class="rightnote">John.</span>
gifts which he had made vnto his sonne John the brother of king Henrie
the sonne; namelie, a thousand pounds in lands by yeare in England of
his demaine and excheats with the appurtenances, and the castell and
countie of Notingham, with the castell of Marlebrough, and the
appurtenances. Also a thousand pounds Aniouin of yearelie reuenues in
Normandie, and two castells there. And in Aniou a thousand pounds
Aniouin, of such lands as belonged to the earle of Aniou, with one
castell in Aniou, and one in Touraine, and another in Maine.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus were the father and sons agr&eacute;ed and made freends, the sonnes
couenanting neuer to withdraw their seruices and bounden dueties from
their father, but to obeie him in all things from that day forward.
Herewith also the peace was renewed betwixt king Henrie and king Lewes,
<span class="rightnote">A marriage concluded.</span>
and for the further confirmation, a new aliance was accorded betwixt
them, which was, that the ladie Adela the daughter of king Lewes should
be giuen in mariage vnto earle Richard the sonne of king Henrie, who
bicause she was not yet of age able to marie, she was conueied into
England to be vnder the guiding of king Henrie, till she came to lawfull
yeares.</p>

passed, brought home his sons in maner aforesaid, who being well pleased
with the agreement, attended their father into Normandie, where Richard
and Geffrey did homage to him, receiuing their othes of allegiance
according to the maner in that case required. But king Henrie

did no homage, for his father (in respect that he was a king) would not
suffer him, and therefore tooke onelie sureties of him for performance
of the couenants on his part, as was thought expedient.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;All this dissention and strife was kindled (no doubt) by the meanes of
certeine sowers of discord, sycophants, parasits, flatterers, clawbacks,
&amp; pickethanks, who had learned their lesson, that</p>

<p class="nogap">and thinking by their embossed sp&eacute;ech to tickle the eares and harts of
the yoong princes, who by reason of their yoong yeares and nakednesse of
experience in the course of worldlie maters, sought their owne
aduancement, euen by flinging firie faggots of dissention betweene them,
whose harts naturall affection had vnited. For by the tenor of the
storie (marke it who will) we shall s&eacute;e that no attempt of the sons
against the father but had originall from the suggestions of euill
disposed persons, who (like eeles that fatten not in faire running
water, but in muddie motes and ponds) sought honour in hurlie burlies, &amp;
reached out long armes to riches by manie a ones impouerishment. This to
be true, the finall euent and issue prooueth; namelie, the mutuall
attonement and reconciliation wouen betweene the father and the sonnes;
their remorse for their vndutifulnes, his louing fauour and
gratiousnesse; their promptnesse to y&eacute;eld to conditions of agreement,
his forwardnes to giue consent to couenants required; their readinesse
to do the old king homage, his acceptable admission of their preferred
seruice; with other circumstances to be collected out of the storie, all
which doo prooue that this their disloiall resistance sprang rather by
others incitement, than of their owne seeking. Thus we s&eacute;e what
alterations happen in the actions of men, and that euill things manie
times (though naturallie bad) doo inferre their contraries, as one

<span class="rightnote">Willi. king of Scots deliuered out of prison with other.</span>
At length king Henrie went to Faleise, and there deliuered out of
captiuitie William king of Scotland, Robert earle of Leicester, Hugh
earle of Chester, with diuerse other Noble men which were kept there as
prisoners, putting them to their ransomes, and receiuing of them pledges
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Prisoners released.</span>
with an oth of allegiance. This king Henrie the father released for his
part the number of nine hundred 69. knights or men of armes (if y&eacute;e list
so to terme them) which had beene taken since the beginning of these
passed warres.</p>

<p>As for king Henrie the sonne he also set at libertie aboue an hundred,
and that without ransome paieng, according to the articles of the peace
(as before you haue heard.) But yet some (as is alreadie specified) were
excepted out of the benefit of that article, as William king of
Scotland, who being not able to paie his ransome in present monie,
deliuered vp in gage foure of the strongest castels within his realme
<span class="rightnote">Castels deliuered by the K. of Scots.</span>
into king Henries hands; namelie, Barwike, Edenbourgh, Roxbourgh, and
Sterling, with condition, that if he brake the peace, and paied not the
monie behind due for his raunsome, king Henrie and his successours
should enioy for euer the same castels. He also couenanted, not to
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
receiue any English rebels into his realme. Other write that the king of
Scots did not onelie become the king of Englands liegeman at this time,
and couenanted to doo homage vnto him for the realme of Scotland, and
all other his lands, but also deliuered the castels of Barwike, and
Roxbourgh to be possessed of the same king of England and his heires for
euer, without any couenant mentioned of morgage.</p>

<p>Things being setled thus in good order, king Henrie leauing his sonne
Henrie at Rouen, went to Argenton, and there held his Christmasse, and
afterwards, namelie in the feast of the purification of our ladie, both
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
the kings (as well the father as the sonne) were at Mauns, and vpon
<span class="yearnote">1175.</span>
their returne from thence into Normandie, came to a communication with
<span class="rightnote">The kings of England and France m&eacute;et at Gisors.</span>
the French king at Gisors, and then being come backe into Normandie at
Bure, the sonne (to put the father out of all doubt and mistrust of any
euill meaning in him) sware fealtie to him against all persons, and so
became his liegeman in the presence
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
of Rothrod archbishop of Rouen,
Henrie bishop of Baieux, William earle of Mandeuille Richard de Humez
his conestable, and manie other.</p>

<p>After this they kept their easter at Chirebourgh, from whence they came
<span class="rightnote">Philip earle of Flanders.</span>
to Caen, where they met with Philip earle of Flanders, who had latelie
before taken on him the crosse, to go to the holie land: where king
Henrie the father required him to release all such couenants as king
Henrie the sonne had made vnto him in time of his last warres, which he
fr&eacute;elie did, and deliuered vp the writing that he had of the same king
concerning those couenants, and so they confirmed vnto him the yearelie
rent which he was woont to receiue out of England, before the said
warres.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
Finallie, when king Henrie had visited the most part of the countrie, he
came to Harflew, and caused his nauie to be decked and rigged, that he
might saile ouer into England. Whilest he tarried heere till his ships
were readie, he sent letters to his sonne king Henrie, willing him to
repaire vnto him, and meaning that he should accompanie him into
<span class="rightnote">Enuious persons readie to forge matters of suspicion.</span>
England. Who at the first was loth to obeie his fathers will and
pleasure herein, bicause some enuious persons about him had put in his
head a doubt, least his father had not altogither forgot his former
grudge, and that he ment at his comming into England to commit him to
prison. Which was a surmize altogither void of likeliehood, considering
that the father, in the whole processe of his actions betweene himselfe
and his sonnes, was so farre from the desire of inflicting any corporall
punishment, or leuieng anie fine vpon them for their misdemenour, that
he alwaies sought meanes of reconcilement and pacification. And though
this Henrie the sonne for his part deserued to be roughlie dealt
withall; yet the father handled him so gentlie with courteous letters &amp;
messages, that shortlie after he came of his owne accord vnto Harflew,
<span class="rightnote">The two kings the father and the sonne returne into England.</span>
from whence shortlie after they sailed both togither ouer into England,
landing at Portsmouth on a fridaie being the ninth of Maie, from thence
they tooke their iournie streight to London, all the waies being full of
people that came to see them, and to shew themselues glad and ioifull of
their concord and happie arriuall. At their comming to the citie they
were receiued with great reioising of the people, beseeching God long to
preserue them both in health and honour.</p>

<span class="rightnote">William de Breause.</span>
The same yeare William de Breause hauing got a great number of Welshmen
into the castell of Abergauennie, vnder a colourable pretext of

corporall oth; That no traueller by the waie amongst them should beare
<span class="rightnote">The Welshm&#275; not well dealt withall.</span>
any bow, or other vnlawfull weapon. Which oth when they refused to take,
bicause they would not stand to that ordinance he condemned them all to
death. This deceit he vsed towards them in reuenge of the death of his
vncle Henrie of Hereford, whom vpon easter euen before, they had through
treason murthered, and were now acquited with the like againe.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> Reignold erle of Cornewall departed this life.</span>
The same yeare died Reignold earle of Cornwall, bastard sonne to king
Henrie the first without heirs male, by reason whereof the king tooke
into his hands all the inheritance of lands and liuings which he held
within England, Normandie and Wales, except certeine portions which the
daughters of the same earle had by assignement allotted to them. Also
Richard erle of Glocester deceassed this yeare, and his sonne Philip
succeeded him.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i> A synod held at London.</span>
The same yeare was a synod of the cleargie kept at Westminster, wherein
many things were decr&eacute;ed for the conseruation of religion. Amongst other

of gouernours, and could haue none placed in them by the time of the
late ciuill warres, should now be committed vnto men worthie to enioy
the same, for the reformation of disorders growne and plentifullie
sproong vp in time of the vacations.</p>

<p>The realme now brought into good order and deliuered from the troubles
of warre, as well at home as abroad, the king being at good leisure
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> The king of Scots dooth homage to the king of

determined to ride about a great part of the realme, and comming to
Yorke, sent for the king of Scots to come and doo his homage. Now the
king of Scots (according to couenants before concluded) came vnto Yorke
in the moneth of August, where dooing his homage about the twentith

had constituted and ordeined to be primat of all Scotland, and of the
Iles belonging to that realme, as well of the Orkeneis as all the other.
Which constitution was obserued by the bishops of those parts manie
yeares togither, though after they renounced their obedience. Whervpon
the archbishops of Yorke (for the time being) continuallie complained,
so that these popes, Paschall the second, Calyxt the second, Honorius,
Innocentius, Eugenius the third, and Adrian the fourth, had the hearing
of the matter, and with often sending their letters, went about to
reduce them to the prouince of Yorke. But the Scots still withstanding
this ordinance, at length the matter thus in controuersie was referred
to pope Alexander, who sent the foresaid cardinall Hugh as well to make
an end of that contention, as of diuerse other: but yet he left it
vndecided.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The king of the Scots commeth to the
parlement.</span>
William king of Scotland came personallie vnto this parlement at
Northampton, by commandement of king Henrie, and brought with him
Richard bishop of S. Andrew, and Josseline bishop of Glascow, with other
bishops and abbats of Scotland, the which being commanded by king Henrie
to shew such subiection to the church of England as they were bound to
doo by the faith which they owght to him, and by the oth of fealtie
which they had made to him, they made this answer, that they had neuer
shewed any subiection to the church of England, nor ought. Against which
deniall, the archbishop of Yorke replied, and brought foorth sufficient
priuileges granted by the forenamed popes, to prooue the subiection of
the Scotish bishops, and naimelie Glascow and Whiterne vnto the see of
Yorke. But bicause the archbishop of Canturburie meant to bring the
Scotish bishops vnder subiection to his see, he wrought so for that time
with the king, that he suffered them to depart home, without y&eacute;elding
any subiection to the church of England. The letters which the foresaid
popes did send touching this matter, were remaining safe and sound
amongst other writings in the colledge at Yorke, when Polydor Virgil
wrote the histories of England, the copies whereof in an old ancient
booke he confesseth to haue s&eacute;ene and read.</p>

But to speake further of things ordered and doone at this parlement

iustices itinerants in euerie of them, as here followeth, Hugh de
Cressie, Walter Fitz Robert, and Robert Mantell, were deputed vnto
Northfolke, Suffolke, Cambridgeshire, Huntingtonshire, Bedfordshire,
Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire: Hugh de Gundeuille, William
Fitz Rafe, and William Basset
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
were appointed to Lincolnshire,
Notinghamshire, Derbishire, Staffordshire, Warwikeshire,
Northamptonshire, and Leicestershire: Robert Fitz Bernard, Richard
Gifford, Roger Fitz Remfrey, were assigned to Kent, Surrey, Hampshire,
Sussex, Berkshire and Oxfordshire: William Fitz Stephan, Berthram de
Verdon, Thurstan Fitz Simon were ordeined to Herefordshire,
Glocestershire, Worcestershire, and Salopshire: Rafe Fitz Stephan,
William Ruffe, and Gilbert Pipard were put in charge with Wilshire,
Dorsetshire, Summersetshire, Deuonshire &amp; Cornwall: Robert de Wals,
Ranulf de Glanuile, and Robert Pikenet were appointed to Yorkeshire,
Richmondshire, Lancashire, Copeland, Westmerland, Northumberland, and
Cumberland.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The oth of the iustices.</span>
The king caused these iustices to sweare vpon the holie euangelists,
that they should k&eacute;epe his assises which he first had ordeined at
Clarendon, and after had renewed here at Northampton, &amp; also caused all
his subiects within the relme of England to k&eacute;epe and obserue the same.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
Moreouer at this councell, king Henrie restored vnto Robert earle of
Leicester all his lands, both on this side the sea, and beyond, in maner
as he held the same fift&eacute;ene daies before the warre. To William de
Albenie earle of Arundell, he gaue the earledome of Sussex. About
midlent, the king with his sonne and the legat came to London, where at
Westminster a conuocation of the cleargie was called, but when the legat
was set, and the archbishop of Canturburie on his right hand as primat

of the realme, the archbishop of Yorke comming in, and disdaining to sit
on the left, where he might s&eacute;eme to giue preheminence vnto the
archbishop of Canturburie (vnmanerlie inough indeed) swasht him downe,
meaning to thrust himselfe in betwixt the legat, and the archbishop of
Canturburie. And where belike the said archbishop of Canturburie was
loth to remooue, he set his buttocks iust in his lap, but he scarslie
touched the archbishops skirt with his bum, when the bishops and other
chapleins with their seruants stept to him, pulled him away, and threw
him to the ground, and beginning to lay on him with bats and fists, the
archbishop of Canturburie yeelding good for euill, sought to saue him
from their hands. Thus was verified in him that sage sentence,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="nogap">The archbishop of Yorke with his rent rochet got vp, and awaie he went
to the king with a great complaint against the archbishop of
Canturburie: but when vpon examination of the matter the truth was
knowne, he was well laught at for his labour, and "that was all the
remedie he got. As he departed so bebuffeted foorth of the conuocation
house towards the king, they cried out vpon him; Go traitor that diddest
betray that holy man Thomas, go get thee hence, thy hands yet stinke of
bloud." The assemblie was by this meanes dispersed, and the legat fled
and got him out of the waie, as he might with shame enough, which is the
common panion and waiting-woman of pride, as one verie well said,</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Appeales made.</span>
After this, followed appealings, the archbishop of Yorke appealed to
Rome, and the legat also for his owne safegard appealed the archbishop
of Canturburie vnto Rome, which archbishop submitting himselfe and his
cause vnder the popes protection, made a like solemne appeale from the
legat to the pope. The legat perceiuing that the matter went otherwise
than he wished, and s&eacute;eing little remedie to be had at that present,
gaue ouer his legatship as it had b&eacute;ene of his owne accord, though
greatlie against his will, and prepared himselfe to depart.
Neuerthelesse, through mediation of fr&eacute;ends that tooke paines betwixt
them, they gaue ouer their appeales on either side, and dissembled the
<span class="rightnote">The conuocation dissolued.</span>
displeasures which they had conceiued either against other, but yet the
conuocation was dissolued for that time, and the two archbishops
presented their complaints to the king, who kept his Easter this yeare
at Winchester, and about the same time or shortlie after, licenced his
sonne Henrie to saile ouer into Normandie, meaning shortlie after to go

discontinued his purpose and staied at home.</p>

<p>The same yeare, the ladie Johan the kings daughter was giuen in marriage

wals both of the towne and castell of Leicester to be raced and all such

the castels of Fremingham and Bungey, with diuers other both in England
and Normandie. But the castels of Pascie, and Mountsorell he reteined in
his owne hands as his of right, being so found by a iurie of fr&eacute;eholders
impanelled there in the countrie; further he seized into his hands all
the other castels of bishops, earles and barons, both in England and

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Gilbert Fitz Fergus.</span>
Moreouer, Gilbert the sonne of Fergus lord of Galloway, who had slaine
his brother Uthred coosen to king Henrie, came this yeare into England,
vnder conduct of William king of Scotland, and became king Henrie the
fathers man, swearing fealtie to him against all men: and to haue his
loue and fauour gaue him a thousand marks of siluer, and deliuered into
his hands his son Duncane as a pledge. It is to be remembred also, that
<span class="rightnote">Richard earle of Poictow.</span>
in this yeare Richard earle of Poictow sonne to king Henrie, fought with
certeine Brabanders his enimies betwixt S. Megrine and Buteuille, where
he ouercame them.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Here I haue thought good to aduertise the reader, that these men of
war, whom we haue generallie in this part of our booke named Brabanders,
we find them written in old copies diuerslie, as Brebazones, Brebanceni,
and Brebationes, the which for so much as I haue found them by the
learned translated Brabanders, and that the French word somewhat
yeeldeth thereto, I haue likewise so named them: wherein whether I haue
erred or not, I must submit mine opinion to the learned &amp; skilfull
searchers of such points of antiquities. For to confesse in plaine truth
mine ignorance, or rather vnresolued doubt herein, I can not satisfie my
selfe with any thing that I haue read, whereby to assure my coniecture
what to make of them, although verelie it may be, and the likelihood is
great, that the Brabanders in those daies for their trained skill and
vsuall practise in warlike feats, wan themselues a name, whereby not
onelie those that were naturallie borne in Brabant, but such also as
serued amongst them, or else vsed the same warlike furniture, order,
trade and discipline, which was in vse among them, passed in that age
vnder the name of Brabanders. Or else I must thinke, that by reason of
some od kind of habit or other speciall cause, a certeine sort of
souldiers purchased to themselues the priuilege of that name, so to be
called Brabanceni or Brebationes (whether ye will) as hath chanced to
the Lansquenetz and Reisters in our time, and likewise to the companions
Arminaes and Escorchers in the daies of our forefathers, and as in all
ages likewise it hath fortuned amongst men of warre. Which if it so
chanced to these Brabanceni, I know not then what countriemen to make
them: for as I remember, Marchades that was a chiefe leader of such
souldiers as were knowne by that name (as after ye shall heare) is
reported by some authors to be a Prouancois.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
It should s&eacute;eme also that they were called by other names, as the Routs
(in Latine Ruptarij) which name whether it came of a French word, as ye
would say some vnrulie and headstrong companie, or of the Dutch word
Rutters, that signifieth a rider, I cannot say. But it may suffice for
the course of the historie to vnderstand that they were a kind of hired
souldiers, in those daies highlie est&eacute;emed, and no lesse feared, in so
much that against them and others there was an article conteined among
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Paruus. lib. 3. cap. 3.</i></span>
the decr&eacute;es of the Laterane councell holden at Rome, in the yeare 1179,
whereby all those were to be denounced accursed, which did hire,
mainteine or any way nourish those Brebationes, Aragonois, Nauarrois,
Basques and Coterelles, which did so much hurt in the christian world in
those daies.</p>

<p>But to returne where we left to earle Richard, beside the aboue
mentioned victorie against those Brabanders, if we shall so take them;
he also vanquished Hamerike vicount of Limoges, and William earle of
Angolesme, with the vicounts of Ventadore and Cambanais, who attempted
rebellion against him, whome earle Richard subdued, and tooke prisoners,
with diuerse castels and strong holds which they had fortified.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The departure of the legat foorth of the Realme.</span>
About the feast of Peter and Paule, the legat departed out of the
realme, of whom we find that as he granted to the king some liberties
against the priuileges which the cleargie pretended to haue a right
vnto: so he obteined of the king certeine grants in fauour of them and
their order, as thus.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Liberties obteined for churchmen.</span>
1 First, that for no offense, crime or transgression any spirituall
person should be brought before a temporall iudge personallie, except
for hunting, or for some laie fee, or that for which some temporall
seruice was due to be y&eacute;elded, either to the king, or some other that
was cheefe lord thereof.</p>

<p>2 Secondlie, that no archbishops see, nor bishops s&eacute;e, nor any abbaie
should be kept in the kings hands more than one yeare, except vpon some
euident cause or necessitie constreining.</p>

<p>3 Thirdlie, that such as slue any spirituall person, and were of such
offense conuicted, either by euidence or confession before the iustice
of the realme in presence of the bishop, should be punished as the
temporall law in such cases required.</p>

<p>4 Fourthlie, that spirituall men should not be compelled to fight in
lists for the triall of any matter or cause whatsoeuer.</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
It should appeare by Nicholas Triuet, that the archbishop of Canturburie
procured the bishops of Winchester, Elie, and Norwich, thr&eacute;e prelats
highlie at that present in the kings fauour, to further these grants;
namelie, that such as slue any pr&eacute;est or spirituall person might haue
the law for it: where before, there was no punishment for a season vsed
against such offendors but onelie excommunication. But now to leaue
preests, we will passe to other matters.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The yoong K. beginneth new practises against his father.</span>
In this meane time, king Henrie the sonne remaining in Normandie, began
to deuise new practises how to remooue his father from the gouernment
and to take it to himselfe; but one of his seruants named Adam de
Cherehedune being of his secret counsell, aduertised king Henrie the
father thereof, for the which his maister king Henrie the sonne</p>

<p class="nogap">put him to great shame and rebuke, causing him to be stripped naked, and
whipped round about the streets of the citie of Poictiers, where he then
was vpon his returne from his brother earle Richard, with whome he had
beene to aid him against his enimies. King Henrie the father perceiuing
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
the naughtie mind of his sonne, and that he ceassed not from his wilfull
maliciousnesse, thought to dissemble all things, sith he saw no hope of
amendment in him: but yet to be prouided against his wicked attempts, he
furnished all his fortresses both in England &amp; in Normandie with strong
garisons of men, and all necessarie munition.</p>

<p>About this time, the sea rose on such a heigth, that manie men were
drowned thereby. Also a great snow fell this yeare, which by reason of
the hard frost that chanced therewith,
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
continued long without wasting
away, so that fishes both in the sea and fresh water died through
sharpenesse and vehemencie of that frost, neither could husbandmen till
the ground. A sore eclipse of the sunne chanced also the sixt ides of
Januarie. The monasterie of Westwood or Lesnos was begun to be founded
by Richard de Lucie Lord ch&eacute;efe iustice. The same yeare also at
Woodstocke the king made his sonne the lord Geffrey knight.</p>

In the yeare 1177. king Henrie held his Christmas at Northampton, with
his two sonnes Geffrey and John, his other two sonnes the yoong king
Henrie, and Richard earle of Poictou, were in the parts beyond the seas,
as the king in Normandie, and the earle in Gascoigne, where he besieged
<span class="rightnote">The citie of Aques or Aigues.</span>
the citie of Aques, which the vicount of Aques and the earle of Bigorre
had fortified against him, but he wan it within ten daies after his
comming thither. Within the like terme also he wan the citie of Baion,
which Arnold Berthram had fortified against him, and c&#333;ming to the
vttermost frontiers of that countrie adioining to Spaine, he tooke a
castell called saint Piero which he destroied, and constreined the
Basques and Nauarrois to receiue an oth, that from thencefoorth they
should suffer passengers quietlie to come and go through their countrie,
and that they should liue in quiet and keepe peace one with an other,
and so he reformed the state of that countrie, and caused them to
renounce manie euill customes which they before that time had
vnlawfullie vsed.</p>

Moreouer, king Henrie, to auoid further slander, placed for bishop in
the see of Lincolne a bastard son which he had named Geffrey, after he
had kept that bishoprike in his hands so long till he had almost
cleerelie destroied it. And his sonne that was now made bishop to helpe
the matter for his part, made hauocke in wasting and spending in riotous
manner the goods of that church, and in the end forsooke his miter, and
left the s&eacute;e againe in the kings hands to make his best of it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the king in times past made a vow to build a new monasterie
in satisfaction of his offenses committed against Thomas the archbishop
of Canturburie: wherefore he required of the bishops and other
spirituall fathers, to haue some place by them assigned, where he might
begin that foundation. But whilest they should haue taken aduise herein,
he secretlie practised with the cardinals, and with diuerse other
bishops, that he might remoue the secular canons out of the colledge at
Waltham, and place therein regular canons, so to saue monie in his
cofers, planting in another mans vineyard. Howbeit, bicause it should
not be thought he did this of such a couetous meaning, he promised to
giue great possessions to that house, which he after but slenderlie
performed, though vpon licence obteined at the bishops hands, he
<span class="rightnote">Pr&eacute;ests displaced, &amp; canons regular put in their roomes.</span>

The same yeare also he thrust the nunnes of Amesburie out of their

kept in more streightlie. And their house was committed vnto the abbesse
and couent of Founteuered, who sent ouer certeine of their number to

prisoners that were taken, the bishop
of Dun was one, whom yet the lord ch&eacute;efe Justice released and set at
libertie, in respect of a request and suit made to him by a cardinall
the popes legat that was there in Ireland at that time.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Viuiano a cardinall.</span>
This cardinals name was Viuiano, intituled the cardinall of S. Stephan
in Mount Celio; he was sent from the pope the yeare before, and comming
into England, though without licence, was pardoned vpon knowledging his
fault for his entring without the kings leaue first obteined, and so
permitted to go into Scotland, whither (as also into other the northwest
regions) he was sent as legat, authorised from the pope. Now when he had
ended his businesse in Scotland, he passed ouer into Man, and there held
his Christmasse with Euthred king of Man, and after the feast of the
Epiphanie, sailed from thence into Ireland, and chanced (the same time
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
that the Englishmen inuaded that countrie) to be in the citie of Dun,
where he was receiued of the king &amp; bishops of that land with great
reuerence.</p>

<p>The inuasion then of the Englishmen being signified to them of the
countrie aforehand they asked counsell of the legat what he thought best
to be doone in that matter; who streightwaies told them, that they ought
to fight in defense of their countrie, and at their setting forward, he
gaue them his benediction in waie of their good speed. But they comming
(as ye haue heard) to encounter with the Englishmen, were put to flight,
and beaten backe into the citie, which was herewith also woone by the
Englishmen, so that the Romane legat was glad to get him into the church
for his more safegard, and like a wise fellow had prouided afore hand
for such haps if they chanced, hauing there with him the king of
Englands letters directed to the capteins in Ireland in the legats
fauour, so that by the assistance and authoritie of the same, he went to
<span class="rightnote">The legat holdeth a councell at Dublin.</span>
Dublin, and there (in the name of the pope and the king of England) held
a councell.</p>

<p>But when he began to practise, after the manner of legats in those
daies, somewhat largelie for his owne aduantage, in the churches of that
simple rude countrie, the English capteins commanded him either to
depart, or else to go foorth to the wars with them: whervpon he returned
into Scotland, hauing his bags well stuffed with Irish gold, for the
which it seemed he greatlie thirsted.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Where we haue to note the drift of the pope and all popelings to be
far otherwise than they pretend. For who (vnlesse he will be wilfullie
ignorant) knoweth not, that he and his neuer attempt any thing, but the
same beareth the hew and colour of holinesse and honestie? Hereto tend
the sendings out of his legats and cardinals to make pacifications, to
redresse disorders, to appease tumults, &amp; I wot not what infinit
enormities (for he must haue his ore in euerie mans bote, his spoone in
euerie mans dish, and his fingers in euerie mans pursse) but the end and
scope of all his doings consisteth in this; namelie, to set himselfe
aboue all souereigntie, to purchase and assure to himselfe an absolute
and supereminent iurisdiction, to rob Christian kingdomes, to impouerish
churches, chapels, and religious places. Our chronicles are full of
these his pranks, and here we haue one practised by a lim of his, who
(as you s&eacute;e) verie impudentlie and licentiouslie preied vpon the
church-goods, and conuerted the same to his owne profit and commoditie:
which he had if not trembled, yet blushed to doo, considering that the
goods of the church are the treasurie of Christ (or at leastwise ought
to be) and that none ought to alienate or change the propertie of such
goods, as the canon law hath prouided. Besides, the wretch ought to haue
remembred that which euen the verie pagans did not forget; namelie,</p>

About the same time came ambassadours vnto king Henrie from Alfonse king
of Castile and Garsias king of Nauarre, to aduertise him, that in a
controuersie risen betwixt the said two kings touching the possession of
certeine grounds n&eacute;ere vnto the confines of their realms, they had
chosen him for iudge by compromise, promising vpon their oths to stand
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
vnto &amp; abide his order and decr&eacute;e therein. Therefore they required him
to end the matter, by his authoritie, sith they had wholie put it to his
iudgement. Furthermore, either king had sent a most able and valiant
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
knight furnished with horsse and armour readie in their princes cause to
fight the combat, if king Henrie should happilie commit the triall of
their quarrell vnto the iudgement of battell. King Henrie gladlie
accepted their request, so that thervpon calling his councellors
togither, he consulted with them of the thing, and hearing euerie mans
opinion, at length he gaue iudgement so with the one, that the other was
contented to be agreeable therevnto.</p>

<p>Within a while after, Philip earle of Flanders came ouer into England to
doo his deuotions at the toome of Thomas archbishop of Canturburie, of
whome the most part of men then had conceiued an opinion of such
holinesse, that they reputed him for a saint. The king met him there,
and verie fr&eacute;endlie enterteined him, and bicause he was appointed
shortlie after to go ouer into the holie land to war against Gods
enimies, the king gaue him fiue hundred marks in reward, and licenced
William Mandeuile earle of Essex to go in that iourneie with other
lords, knights and men of warre of sundrie nations that were of his
dominions.</p>

<p>The king then returning vnto London, tooke order for the establishing of
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
things touching the suertie of the realme, and his owne estate. And
first he appointed the custodie of such castels as were of most
importance by their situation, vnto the k&eacute;eping of certeine worthie
capteins. To sir William de Stuteuille he assigned the custodie of
Rockesburgh castell, to sir Roger de Stuteuille the castell of
Edenburgh, to sir William Neuille the castell of Norham, to sir Geffrie
Neuille the castell of Berwike, and to the archbishop of Yorke he
deliuered the castell of Scarborough, and sir Roger Coniers he made
<span class="rightnote">Durham tower.</span>
capteine of the tower of Durham, which he had taken from the bishop,
bicause he had shewed himselfe an vnstedfast man in the time of the
ciuill warre, and therefore to haue the kings fauour againe, he gaue to
him two thousand marks, with condition that his castels might stand, and
<span class="rightnote">Henrie de Pudsey</span>
that his sonne Henrie de Putsey ali&agrave;s Pudsey, might enioy one of the
kings manor places called Wighton.</p>

<i>Polydor.</i><br />
It
rained blood.</span>
After this, the king went to Oxenford, and there held a parlement, at
the which he created his sonne John king of Ireland, hauing a grant and
confirmation thereto from pope Alexander. About the same time it rained
bloud in the Ile of Wight, by the space of two daies togither, so that
linen clothes that hoong on the hedges were coloured therewith: which
vnvsed woonder caused the people, as the manner is, to suspect some
euill of the said Johns gouernement.</p>

<p>Moreouer, to this parlement holden at Oxenford, all the ch&eacute;efe rulers
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
and gouernours of Southwales and Northwales repaired, and became the
king of Englands liege men, swearing fealtie to him against all men.
H&eacute;erevpon he gaue unto Rice ap Griffin<a name="FNanchor_5_11" id="FNanchor_5_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> prince of Southwales the land of
Merionith, and to Dauid ap Owen he gaue the lands of Ellesmare. Also at
the same time he gaue and confirmed vnto Hugh Lacie (as before is said)
the land of Meth in Ireland with the appurtenances, for the seruice of
an hundred knights or men of armes, to hold of him and of his sonne John
by a charter which he made thereof. Also he diuided there the lands and
possessions of Ireland with the seruices to his subiects, as well of
England as Ireland, appointing some to hold by seruice to find fortie
knights or men of armes, and some thirtie, and so foorth.</p>

<p>Vnto two Irish lords he granted the kingdome of Corke for the seruice of
fortie knights, and to other three lords he gaue the kingdome of
Limerike for the seruice of the like number of knights to be held of him
&amp; his sonne John, reseruing to himselfe &amp; to
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
his heires the citie of
<span class="rightnote">William Fitz Adelme. Robert de Poer. Hugh Lacie.</span>
Limerike with one cantred. To William Fitz Adeline his sewer, he gaue
the citie of Wesseford with the appurtenances and seruices: and to
Robert de Poer his marshall, he gaue the citie of Waterford; and to Hugh
Lacie, he committed the safe keeping of the citie of Diueline. And these
persons, to whome such gifts and assignations were made, receiued othes
of fealtie to beare their allegiance vnto him and to his sonne for those
lands and possessions in Ireland, in maner and forme as was requisite.</p>

<p>The cardinall Viuian hauing dispatched his businesse in Ireland, came
backe into England, and by the kings safe conduct returned againe into
Scotland, where in a councell holden at Edenburgh, he suspended the
bishop of Whiterne, bicause he did refuse to come to that councell: but
the bishop made no account of that suspension, hauing a defense good
inough by the bishop of Yorke, whose suffragane he was.</p>

<p>After the king had dissolued and broken vp his parlement at Oxenford, he
<span class="rightnote">Philip de Breause.</span>
came to Marleborrough, and there granted vnto Philip de Breause all the
kingdome of Limerike for the seruice of fortie knights: for Hubert and
William the brethren of Reignold earle of Cornewall, and John de la
Pumeray their nephue, refused the gift thereof, bicause it was not as
yet conquered. For the king thereof, surnamed Monoculus, that is, with
one eie, who had held that kingdome of the king of England, being
latelie slaine, one of his kinsemen got possession of that kingdome, and
held it without acknowledging any subiection to king Henrie, nor would
obeie his officers, bicause of the losses and damages which they did
practise against the Irish people, without occasion (as they alleadged)
by reason whereof the king of Corke also rebelled against the king of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
England and his people, and so that realme was full of trouble.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polychr.</i></span>
The same season, qu&eacute;ene Margaret the wife of king Henrie the sonne was
deliuered of a man child which liued not past thr&eacute;e daies. In that time
there was also through all England a great multitude of Jewes, and
<span class="rightnote">Jewes in England.</span>
bicause they had no place appointed them were to burie those that died,
but onelie at London, they were constrained to bring all their dead
corpses thither from all parts of the realme. To ease them therfore of
that inconuenience, they obteined of king Henrie a grant, to haue a
place assigned them in euerie quarter where they dwelled, to burie their
dead bodies. The same yeare was the bodie of S. Amphibulus the martyr,
who was instructor to saint Albone found, not farre from the towne of S.
Albones, and there in the monasterie of that towne buried with great and
solemne ceremonies.</p>

<p>In the meane time, king Henrie passed ouer into Normandie, hearing that
the old grudge betwixt him &amp; king Lewes began to be renewed vpon this
occasion, that whereas king Henrie had receiued the French kings
daughter Alice, promised in mariage vnto his sonne Richard, to remaine
in England with him, till she were able to companie with hir husband,
king Henrie being of a dissolute life, and giuen much to the pleasure of
the bodie (a vice which was grafted in the bone and therefore like to
sticke fast in the flesh, for as it is said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quod noua testa capit inueterata sapit)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nogap">at least wise (as the French king suspected) began to fantasie the yoong
ladie, and by such wanton talke and companie-keeping as he vsed with
hir, he was thought to haue brought hir to consent to his fleshlie lust,
which was the cause wherefore he would not suffer his sonne to marrie
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
hir, being not of ripe yeares nor viripotent or mariable. Wherefore the
French king imagining (vpon consideration of the other kings former
loose life) what an inconuenience &amp; infamie might redound to him and
his, bethought himselfe that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Turpe senex miles turpe senilis amor,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nogap">and therefore d&eacute;emed iustlie that such a vile reproch wrought against
him in his bloud, was in no wise to be suffered, but rather preuented,
resisted &amp; withstood. Herevpon he complained to the pope, who for
redresse thereof, sent one Peter a pr&eacute;est, &amp; cardinall intituled of
saint Grisogone as legat from him into France, with commission to put
Normandie
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
and all the lands that belonged to king Henrie vnder
inderdiction, if he would not suffer the mariage to be solemnized
without delaie betwixt his sonne Richard and Alice the French kings
daughter. The king aduertised hereof, came to a communication with the
<span class="rightnote">The kings m&eacute;et at Yurie.</span>
French king at Yurie, vpon the 21. of September, and there offered to
cause the mariage to be solemnised out of hand, if the French king would
giue in marriage with his daughter the citie of Burges, with all the
appurtenances as it was accorded, and also vnto his sonne king Henrie
the countrie of Veulgesine, that is to say, all the land betwixt Gisors
and Pussie, as he had likewise couenanted.</p>

<p>But bicause the French king refused so to doo, king Henrie would not
suffer his sonne Richard to marrie his daughter Alice: howbeit at this
entervew of the two princes, by the helpe of the cardinall, and other
Noble men on both sides, they agreed to be freends, and that if they
could not take order betwixt them, to end all matters touching the
controuersies depending betwixt them for the lands in Auuergne and
Berrie, and for the f&eacute;e of Chateau Raoul; then should the matter be put
to twelue persons, six on the one side, and six on the other,
authorising them to compound and finish that controuersie and all other
which might rise betwixt them. For the French king these were named, the
bishops of Claremount, Neuers, and Trois; and three barons, erle
Theobald, Robert, and Peter de Courtneie, the kings bretheren. For the
king of England were named the bishops of Mauns, Peregort, and Naunts;
with three barons also, Maurice de Croume, William Maigot and Peter de
Mountrabell.</p>

<p>At the same time also, both these kings promised and vndertooke to ioine
their powers togither, and to go into the holie land to aid Guido king
of Jerusalem, whome the Saracen Saladine king of Aegypt did sore
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> A law.</span>
oppresse with continuall and most cruell war. This doone, the French
king returned home, and king Henrie came to Vernueil, where he made this
ordinance, that no man should trouble the vassall or tenant, as we may
call them, for his lords debt.</p>

<p>After this king Henrie went into Berrie, and tooke Chateau Roux or
Raoul, and marching towards Castre, the lord of that towne came and met
him on the waie, surrendring into his hands the daughter of Rafe de
Dolis latelie before deceassed, whome the king gaue vnto Baldwine de
Riuers, with the honor of Chateau Roux or Raoul. Then went he vnto
Graundemont, where Audebert earle of March came vnto him, and sold to
<span class="rightnote">The purchase of the erldome of March.</span>
him the whole countrie of March for the summe of fifteene thousand
pounds Anioun, twentie mules, and twentie palfreis. The charters of this
grant and sale made and giuen vnder the seale of the said earle of
March, bare date in the moneth of September Anno Christi 1177. Then did
the king receiue the fealtie and homages of all the barons and knights
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;24.</span>
of the countrie of March, after he had satisfied, contented, and paid
the monie vnto the earle according to the couenants.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1178.</span>
The king this yeare held his Christmas at Angiers, and meaning shortlie
after to returne into England, he sent to the French king for letters of
protection, which were granted, and sent to him in forme as followeth.</p>

<p>Shortlie after, king Henrie returned into England from Normandie, and at
Woodstocke made his sonne Geffrey knight. This yeare pope Alexander sent
into all parts legats to summon the bishops and prelates to a generall
<span class="rightnote">A generall councell summoned at Rome.</span>
councell to be holden at Rome in the beginning of the Lent in the yere
next following. Whereabout two legats came into England, the one named
Albert de Suma, who had in commission to summon them of England and
Normandie: and the other called Petro de Santa Agatha, who was appointed
to summon them of Scotland, Ireland, and the Iles about the same:
wherevpon obteining licence to passe through the king of Englands
dominions, he was constreined to sweare vpon the holie euangelists, that
he should not attempt any thing in his legatship that might be hurtfull
to the king or his realme, and that he should come and visit the king
againe as he returned homewards.</p>

<p>This yeare on the sundaie before the natiuitie of S. John Baptist, being
the 18 of June, after the setting of the sunne, there appeared a
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
maruellous sight in the aire, vnto certeine persons that beheld the
same. For whereas the new moone shone foorth verie faire with his hornes
<span class="rightnote">A strange sight about the moone.</span>
towardes the east, streightwais the vpper horne was diuided into two,
out of the the mids of which diuision a burning brand sprang vp, casting
from it a farre off coles and sparks, as it had beene of fire. The bodie
of the moone in the meane time that was beneath, s&eacute;emed to wrest and
writh in resemblance like to an adder or snake that had b&eacute;ene beaten,
and anon after it came to the old state againe. This chanced aboue a
dozzen times, and at length from horne to horne it became blacke.</p>

<p>In September following, the moone being about 27. daies hold, at six of
the clocke, a partile eclipse of the sunne happened, for the bodie
thereof appeared as it were horned shooting the hornes towards the west
<span class="rightnote">A strange eclipse of the sunne.</span>
as the moone dooth: being twentie daies old. The residue of the compasse
of it was couered with a blacke roundell, which comming downe by little
and little, threw about the horned brightnesse that remained, till both
the hornes came to hang downe on either side to the earthwards; and as
the blacke roundell went by little &amp; little forwards, the homes at
length were turned towards the west, and so the blacknesse passing
awaie, the sunne receiued his brightnesse againe. In the meane time the
aire being full of clouds of diuerse colours, as red, yellow, green, and
pale, holpe the peoples sight with more ease to discerne the maner of
it.</p>

<p>The king this yeare held his Christmasse at Winchester, at which time
newes came abroad of a great wonder that had chanced at a place called
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;25. <br />
1179.</span>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Oxenhale, within the lordship of Derlington, in which place a part of
the earth lifted itselfe vp on high in appearance like to a mightie
tower, and so it remained from nine of the clocke in the morning, till
the euen tide, and then it fell downe with an horrible noise, so that as
<span class="rightnote">A strange wonder of the earth.</span>
such as were thereabout, were put in a great feare. That p&eacute;ece of earth
with the fall was swallowed vp, leauing a great d&eacute;epe pit in the place,
as was to be seene many yeares after.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Touching these celestiall apparitions, the common doctrine of
philosophie is, that they be m&eacute;ere naturall, and therefore of no great
admiration. For of eclipses, as well such as are proper to the sunne, as
also those that are peculiar to the moone, the position is not so
generallie deliuered, as it is constantlie bel&eacute;eued. For the
philosophers giue this reason of eclipses.</p>

matter woorth the marking, to compare effects following with signes and
woonders before going; since they haue a doctrine in them of no small

might be imported by the extraordinarie eclipse of the sunne, a
beautifull creature, and the ornament of the skie.</p>

<p>Laurence archbishop of Dublin, and Catholicus the archbishop of Tuamon,
with fiue or six other Irish bishops, and diuerse both bishops and
abbats of Scotland, passed through England towards the generall
councell, and withall tooke their oth, that they shuld not procure any
damage to the king or realme of England. There went but onelie foure
bishops out of England, to wit, Hugh Putsey, or Pudsey bishop of Durham,
John bishop of Norwich, Reignold bishop of Bath, and Robert bishop of

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A parlement at Windsore.</span>
King Henrie the father called a parlement at Windsore, at the which was
present king Henrie the sonne, and a great number of lords, earles and
barons. At this parlement, order was taken for partition of the realme,
so that it was diuided into foure parts, certeine sage personages being
allotted vnto euerie part to gouerne the same, but not by the name of
<span class="rightnote">Ranulfe de Glanuille.</span>

Louaine, Philip earle of Flanders, Baldwin earle of Guines, earle
William de Mandeuille, and diuerse other earles, lords, barons and
knights; whome king Henrie was readie to receiue at the water side, and
the morow after brought them with great honor to Canturburie, where they
were with due reuerence and vnspeakeable ioy receiued of archbishop
Richard, and diuerse other bishops there assembled togither with the
couent of Christes-church, and an infinit multitude of Nobles and
<span class="rightnote">The French word is Muis.</span>
gentlemen. The French king offered vpon the toome of the said archbishop
Thomas, a rich cup of gold; and gaue to the moonks there an hundred tuns
of wine to be receiued yearelie of his gift for euer at Poissie in
France. Further he granted to the same moonks, that whatsoeuer was
bought in his dominions of France to their vse, should be free from
toll, tallage, and paieng any maner of excise for the same.

These

causing his sonne to be crowned king, resigned the gouernment to him (as
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> Cadwallon prince of Wales.</span>
by some writers appeareth.) About the same time, Cadwallon prince of
Wales, being brought before the king to make his answer to diuerse
accusations exhibited against him, as he returned toward his countrie
vnder the kings safe conduct, was laid for by his enimies, and slaine,

<span class="rightnote">Discord betwixt the French K. and his nobles.</span>
The same yeare fell discord betwixt the yoong king of France, and his
mother and vncles, hir brethren, earle Theobald and earle Stephan, who
thinking themselues not well vsed, procured king Henrie the sonne to
ioine with them in fr&eacute;endship, and to go ouer into England to purchase
his fathers assistance in their behalfe against their nephue. Who being
come ouer to his father, informed him of the whole mater, and did so
much by his earnest suit therin, that before the feast of Easter, his
father went ouer with him into Normandie, and immediatlie vpon their
arriuall in those parts, the old French qu&eacute;ene, mother to the yoong king
Philip, with their brethren the said earles, and manie other Noble men

againe into his fauour, couenanting to allow his mother for euerie day
towards hir expenses seuen pounds of Paris monie, during his father king
Lewes his life time; and after his death, she should enioy all hir

yearelie out of the checker at London, so that in consideration thereof
he should find fiue hundred knights or men of armes, to serue the king
of England for the space of 40. daies, when soeuer he should haue
warning giuen vnto him.</p>

<p>Moreouer, the two kings at this assemblie concluded a league togither,
and whereas certeine lands were in controuersie betwixt them, as the f&eacute;e
of Chateau Raoul, and other small fees, if they could not agree among
themselues concerning the same, either of them was contented to commit
the order thereof, and of all other controuersies betwixt them vnto six
bishops, to be chosen indifferentlie betwixt them, the one to choose
thr&eacute;e, and the other thr&eacute;e.</p>

In this yeare, or (as the annales of Aquitaine say) in the yeare last
passed, Richard earle of Poictou subdued the strong fortresse of
Tailbourg, which was iudged before that time, inexpugnable: but earle
Richard oppressed them that kept it so sore with streight siege, that
first in a desperate mood they issued foorth, and assailed his people
verie valiantlie, but yet neuerthelesse they were beaten backe, and
forced to retire into their fortresse, which finallie they surrendred
into the hands of earle Richard, who caused the wals thereof to be
raced. The like fortune chanced to diuers other castels and fortresses
that stood in rebellion against him within a moneth space.</p>

<p>Tailbourg belonged vnto one Geffrey de Rancin, who of a proud and loftie

King Henrie the father, whilest he was at Mauns after Christmasse made
this ordinance, that euerie man being worth in goods to the value of an
hundred pounds Aniouin, should keepe one horsse able for seruice in the
wars, and complet armour for a knight or man of armes, as we may rather
call them. Also that such as had goods woorth in value from 40. pounds
to 25. of the same monie, should at the least haue in his house for his
furniture an habergeon, a cap of st&eacute;ele, a speare, and a sword, or bowe
and arrowes. Furthermore he ordeined, that no man might sell or laie to
gage his armour and weapon, but should be bound to leaue it to his next
heire. When the French king and the earle of Flanders were aduertised
that king Henrie had made this ordinance amongst his subiects, they gaue
commandement that their people should be armed after the like manner.</p>

This yeare after Candlemasse, Laurence archbishop of Dublin came ouer to
the king into Normandie and brought with him the son of Roderike king of
Conagh, to remaine with him as a pledge, for performance of couenants
passed betwixt them, as the paiment of tribute and such like. The said
archbishop died there in Normandie, wherevpon the king sent Geffrey de
Haie one of his chapleins, and chapleine also to Alexius the popes legat
into Ireland, to seize that archbishops s&eacute;e into his hands. He also sent
John Lacie conestable of Chester, and Richard de Peake, to haue the
citie of Dublin in k&eacute;eping, which Hugh Lacie had in charge before and
now was discharged, bicause the king tooke displeasure with him, for
that without his licence he had maried a daughter of the king of Conagh,
according to the manner of that countrie.</p>

<p>This yeare also, Geffrey the kings bastard sonne, who was the elect of
Lincolne, and had receiued the profits of that bishoprike, by the space
of seuen years, and had his election confirmed by the pope in the feast
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
of the Epiphanie at Marlebridge, in presence of the king and bishops
renounced that preferment, of his owne free will. Within a while after
the pope sent a streit commandement vnto Richard archbishop of
Canturburie, either to cause the same Geffrey by the censure of the
church to renounce his miter, or else to take vpon him the order of
pr&eacute;esthood. Wherefore vpon good aduice taken in the matter with his
father and other of his especiall fr&eacute;ends, iudging himselfe insufficient
for the one, he was contented to part with the other; and therevpon
wrote letters vnto the said archbishop of Canturburie, in forme as

<p>The king for his maintenance, now after he had resigned his bishoprike,
gaue him 500. markes of yearelie rent in England, and as much in
Normandie, and made him moreouer lord chancellor.</p>

<p>This yeare also after Easter, the kings of England and France came to an
enteruew togither, at a place in the confines of their countries called
by some writers Vadum Sancti Remigij, on a mondaie being the 17. of
April, in which assemblie of those two princes, the knights templers and
hospitallers presented to them letters directed from pope Alexander vnto
<span class="rightnote">The danger of the holie land.</span>
all christian princes, aduertising them of the danger wherein the holie
land stood at that present, if sp&eacute;edie remedie were not the sooner
prouided. Wherefore he exhorted them to addresse their helping hand
towards the releefe thereof, granting vnto all such as would enterprise
to go thither in person (to remaine there vpon defense of the countrie
against the infidels) great pardon, as to those that did continue there
the space of two y&eacute;eres, pardon of penance for all their sins, except
theft, extortion, roberie, and vsurie; in which cases restitution was to
be made, if the partie were able to doo it; if not, then he should he
absolued as well for those things as for other. And those that remained
one yeare in those parties were pardoned of halfe their whole penance
due for all their sinnes. And to those that went to visit the holie
sepulchre, he also granted great pardon, as remission of their sinnes,
whether they came thither or peraduenture died by the waie. He also
granted his fr&eacute;e indulgence vnto those that went to warre against the
common, the professed and open enimies of our religion in the holie
land, as his predecessors the popes Vrbanus and Eugenius had granted in
time past: and he receiued likewise their wiues, their children, their
goods and possessions vnder the protection of S. Peter and the church of
Rome.</p>

<p>The two kings hauing heard the popes letters read, and taken good aduice
thereof, promised by Gods fauour shortlie to provide conuenient aid for
rel&eacute;efe of the holie land, and of the christians as yet remaining in the
same. This was the end of their communication for that time, and so they
departed, the French king into France, and the king of England into
Normandie.</p>

<p>In the meane time, by the king of Englands appointment, William king of
Scotland went ouer into Normandie, and by the aduice and good admonition
of king Henrie, he granted licence vnto two bishops of his realme of
Scotland, to wit, Aberdene and saint Andrewes, to returne into Scotland,
whome he had latelie before banished, and driuen out of his realme.
Moreouer, as king Henrie laie at Harfl&eacute;et readie to saile ouer into
England, discord fell betwixt the king of France and the erle of
Flanders, so that the king of England at desire of the French king
returned backe, and came vnto Gisors, where the French king met him, and
so did the earle of Flanders, betwixt whome vpon talke had in the matter
depending in controuersie, he made a concord, and then comming downe, to
Chirburge he and the king of Scots in his companie passed ouer into
England, landing at Portesmouth the 26. of Julie.</p>

<p>The king now being returned into England, ordeined a statute for armour
<span class="rightnote">An ordinance for armour.</span>
and weapon to be had amongst his subiects heere in this realme, which
was thus. Euerie man that held a knights f&eacute;e should be bound to haue a
paire of curasses, an helmet, with shield and speare; and euerie knight
or man of arms should haue as manie curasses, helmets, shields and
speares as he held knights f&eacute;es in demaine. Euerie man of the laitie
hauing
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
goods or reuenues to the value of sixteene marks, should have
one paire of curasses, an helmet, a speare, and a shield. And euerie
free man of the laitie hauing goods in value worth ten marks, should
haue an habergeon, a steele cap, &amp; a speare; and all burgesses, and the
whole communaltie of fr&eacute;e men should haue a wambais, a cap of steele,
and a speare.</p>

<p>Further it was ordeined, that euerie man thus bound to haue armour,
should be sworne to haue the same before the feast of S. Hilarie, and to
be true vnto king Henrie Fitz-empres, in defense of whome and of his
realme they should k&eacute;epe with them such armour and weapon, according to
his precept and commandement thereof had and made. And no man being
furnished with such armour, should sell, pledge, or otherwise alien the
same, neither may his lord by any means take the same from him, either
by waie of forfeiture, by destresse or pledge, nor by any other means:
and when any man died, hauing such armour, he shall leaue it to his
heire, and if his heire be not of lawfull age to weare it into the
field, then he that hath the custodie of his bodie shall haue the
armour, and find an able man to weare it for him, till he come to age.</p>

<p>If any burgesse of any good towne haue more armour than he ought to haue
by this statute, he shall sell it or giue it to some man that may weare
<span class="rightnote">Jewes might haue no armour.</span>
it in the kings seruice. No Jew might haue armour by this statute: but
those that had anie, were appointed to sell the same to such as were
inhabitants within the realme, for no man might sell or transport anie
armour ouer the sea, without the kings licence. For the better execution
of which ordinance, it was ordeined, that inquests should be taken by
sufficient iurors, what they were that were able to haue armour by their
abilitie in lands and goods. Also the K. would, that none should be
sworne to haue armour, except he were a fr&eacute;e man of birth and bloud.</p>

<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
The same yeare, the king being at Waltham, assigned an aid to the
maintenance of the christian souldiers in the holie land, that is to
wit, 42. thousand marks of siluer, and fiue hundred marks of gold. Hugh
<span class="rightnote">The decesse of Hugh earle of Chester. <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i></span>

behind him issue by his wife, the countesse Beatrice daughter of Richard
Lacie lord iustice of England, a sonne named Ranulfe, who succ&eacute;eded him,
being the first erle of Chester, &amp; third of that name after the
conquest. Besides this Ranulfe he had foure daughters by his said wife;
to wit, Maud married to Dauid earle of Angus, Huntington and Galloway;
Mabell coupled with William Daubignie earle of Arundell, Agnes married
to William Ferrers earle of Derbie, and Hauise ioined with Robert
Quincie earle of Lincolne.</p>

<span class="rightnote">The archbish. of Yorke deceasseth.</span>
The 21. of Nouember, Roger archbishop of Yorke died, who (when he
perceiued himselfe in danger of death by force of that his last
sicknesse) deliuered great summes of monie vnto certeine bishops and
other graue personages to be distributed amongst poore people: but after
his death, the king called for the monie, and seized it to his vse,
alleadging a sentence giuen by the same archbishop in his life time,
that no ecclesiasticall person might giue any thing by will, except he
deuised the same whilest he was in perfect health: yet the bishop of
Durham would not depart with foure hundred marks which he had receiued
to destribute amongst the poore, alledging that he dealt the same awaie
before the archbishops death, and therefore he that would haue it
againe, must go gather it vp of them to whom he had distributed it,
which he himselfe would in no wise doo. But the king tooke no small
displeasure with this vndiscr&eacute;et answer, insomuch that he seized the
castell of Durham into his hands, and sought means to disquiet the said
bishop by diuerse maner of waies.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1182.</span>
The king held his Christmasse this yeare at Winchester, and afterwards
<span class="rightnote">The K. passeth ouer into Normandie.</span>
sailed ouer into Normandie, bicause he heard that the king his sonne was
gone to his brother in law king Philip, and began to practise eftsoones
new trouble, which was true ind&eacute;ed: but yet at length he came backe, and
<span class="rightnote">The K. &amp; his sonne eftsoones reconciled.</span>
was reconciled to his father, and tooke an oth, that from thenceforth he
would neuer swarue from him, nor demand more for his maintenance but an

<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
monie for his wife. His father granted this, and also couenanted, that
within the tearme of one yeare he would giue him the seruices of an
hundred knights. Neuerthelesse all this did little amend the matter, for
though he set a new copie of countenance therevpon, yet he reteined his
old peruerse purpose in his discontented mind, hauing learned that</p>

<p class="nogap">After this, king Henrie the father as a mediator betwixt the king of

did so much in the matter, that he set them at one for that time.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
About the same season, king Henrie the father sent William de Mandeuille
earle of Albemarle, and other ambassadors vnto the emperour Frederike,
<span class="rightnote">The duke of Saxonie.</span>
to intreat for his sonne in law the duke of Saxonie, that he might be
againe restored into his fauor, which could not be obteined: for he was
alreadie condemned to exile, but yet thus much to pleasure the king of
England the emperour granted, that so manie as went with him out of
their countrie, might returne againe at their pleasure, and that his
wife the dutches Maud the K. of Englands daughter, should inioy hir
dowrie, and be at libertie, whether she would remaine vpon it, or follow
hir husband into exile, therefore when the daie came that he must depart
out of his countrie, he set forward with his wife and children, and a
great number of the Nobles of his countrie, and finallie came into
Normandie, where he was right ioifullie receiued of his father in law
king Henrie.</p>

<p>Shortlie after his comming thither, he gaue licence to the Noble men
that were come thither with him, to returne home, and then he himselfe
went into Spaine to visit the bodie of S. James the apostle. His wife

at Caen, with his thr&eacute;e sons, Henrie the king, Richard earle of Poictow,
and Geffrey earle of Britaine. There was also Henrie duke of Saxonie,
with his wife and their children, besides the archbishops of Canturburie
and Dublin, with other bishops earles and barons in great number.</p>

<p>Here would king Henrie the father, that his son the king should receiue
homage of his brethren Richard earle of Poictow, and Geffrey earle of
Britaine. The earle of Britaine did not staie at the matter, but the
earle of Poictow refused, alledging that it was not conuenient so long
as their father liued, to acknowledge any superioritie to their brother:
for as the fathers inheritance was due to the eldest sonne, so he
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
claimed the lands which he held due to him in right of his mother. This
deniall so much offended his brother the king, that afterwards when
Richard would haue doone homage, he would not receiue it, whervpon
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
Richard departed from the court in great displeasure, &amp; comming into
Poictow, began to fortifie his castels &amp; townes, that he might be in
readinesse to stand vpon his safegard, if his father or brethren should
come to pursue him. King Henrie the sonne followed him, set on by the
earles and barons of Poictow, which for the sharpe and cruell
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
gouernement of earle Richard, hated him mortallie. Againe on the other
side, the fauourable courtesie, s&eacute;emelie personage, and other noble
qualities which they saw in the yoong king, moued them to take part with
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> War betwixt the brethren.</span>
him against Richard, and shortlie after their brother Geffrey came with
a great armie in aid of his brother the king, in so much that earle
Richard not knowing how to shift off the present danger, sent to his
father for aid, who being verie sorie in his mind to s&eacute;e such vnnaturall
dealing among his sonnes, gathered an armie and set forward.</p>

<p>He had a little before trauelled to set them at one, in somuch that
where earle Richard held a castell named Clareualx, which after the
fathers deceasse ought to remaine vnto king Henrie the son, vpon his
complaint thereof made, the father did so much with the earle, that he
surrendered it into his fathers hands. Immediatlie after all the three
<span class="rightnote">The father s&eacute;eketh to appease the quarell betwixt his

sonnes came to Angers, and there sware to be obedient vnto their fathers
will, and to serue him against all men: whervpon he appointed them a
daie to meet at Mirabell, where the barons of Guien should also be, vnto
whom king Henrie the sonne had
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
sworne to aid them against earle
Richard. Herewith was earle Geffrey sent vnto them to persuade them to
peace and quietnesse, and to come vnto Mirabell according to king Henrie
<span class="rightnote">Earle Geffrey dealeth vnfaithfullie.</span>
the fathers appointment: but in st&eacute;ed of persuading them to peace
(contrarie to his oth so oftentimes receiued) he procured them to pursue
the warre both against his father and his brother earle Richard: and no
maruell, for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mal&egrave; sarta gratia nunquam ben&egrave; coalescit.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>King Henrie the sonne remaining with his father, shewed outwardlie that
he wished for peace, but his meaning was all contrarie, and so obtained
licence of his father to go vnto Limoges, that he might labour to reduce
both his brother Geffrey, and the barons of Guien vnto quietnesse. But
such dissembling was put in practise by king Henrie, that when the
father followed with an armie, and came vnto Limoges, in st&eacute;ed of
receiuing him with honor, as it had b&eacute;ene their duties to haue doone,
they shot at him, and pearsed through his vppermost armor, so that both
he and his sonne Richard were constreined to depart. Howbeit afterwards
he entered that citie, and comming foorth of it againe to talke with his
sonnes, those within Limoges eftsoones rebelled, so that certeine of
them within, shot the horsse whereon king Henrie the father rode into
the head. And if it had so chanced, that the horsse in casting vp his
head had not receiued the blow, the arrow had light in the kings brest,
to the great danger &amp; perill of his person. Neither did his sonnes the
king and his brother Geffrey go about to s&eacute;e such an heinous attempt
punished, but rather s&eacute;emed to like well of it, and to mainteine those
most malicious enimies of their souereigne lord and father, for they
ioined with them against him, although king Henrie the sonne made
countenance to be willing to reconcile his brother and the barons of
<span class="rightnote">The disloiall dissembling of the yoong king.</span>
Guien to his father by waie of some agr&eacute;ement: but his double dealing
was too manifest, although indeed he abused his fathers patience for a
while, who was desirous of nothing more than to win his sonnes by some
courteous meanes, and therefore diuerse times offered to pardon all
offenses committed by his enimies, at the suit of his sonne the king,
who in d&eacute;ed offered himselfe now and then as an intreatour, but that was
onelie to win time that his brother with such Brabanders and other
souldiers as he had with him in aid, beside the forces of the barons of
Guien, might worke the more misch&eacute;efe against their father and their
brother earle Richard, in wasting and destroieng their countries that
stood stedfast on their side.</p>

<p>In the meane time Richard the archbishop of Canturburie, and diuerse
other bishops and abbats both of England and Normandie assembled
togither at Caen, and in the abbeie church of S. Stephan pronounced the
sentence of excommunication against all those that did hinder and
impeach their purpose, which was to haue peace and concord concluded
betwixt the king and his sonnes, the same sonnes onlie out of the said
sentence excepted.</p>

<p>Diuerse shiftes were made by king Henrie the sonne, and his brother
earle Geffrey also to get monie for the paiment of their souldiers, as
spoiling of shrines, and such like. But at length when things framed not
to their purpose, and that the harme which they could doo against their
father was much lesse than they wished, if power had b&eacute;ene answerable to
their willes, king Henrie the sonne through indignation and displeasure
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie the sonne falleth sicke.</span>
(as some write) fell into a gr&eacute;euous sicknesse in a village called
Mertell, not farre from Limoges, where his father laie at siege.</p>

<p>At the first he was taken with an extreame feuer, and after followed a
sore flixe. Now perceiuing himselfe in danger of death, and that the
<span class="rightnote">He sendeth to his father.</span>
physicians had giuen him ouer, he sent to his father (better late than
neuer) confessing his trespasse committed against him, and required of
all fatherlie loue to come &amp; s&eacute;e him once before he died. But for that
the father thought not good to commit himselfe into the hands of such
vngratious persons as were about his sonne, he sent his ring vnto him in
token of his blessing, and as it were a pledge to signifie that he had
forgiuen him his vnnaturall doings against him. The son receiuing it
with great humilitie, kissed it, and so ended his life in the presence
of the
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
archbishop of Burdeaux and others, on the day of saint Barnabie
the apostle. He died (as some write) verie penitent and sorowfull.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">His repentance before his death.</span>
And whereas in his life time he had vowed to make a iourneie into the
holie land against Gods enimies, and taken vpon him the crosse for that
intent, he deliuered it vnto his familiar freend William Marshall to go
thither with it in his stead. Moreouer when he perceiued present death
at hand, he first confessed his sinnes secretlie, and after openly
before sundrie bishops and men of religion, and receiued absolution in
most humble wise. After this, he caused his fine clothes to be taken
<span class="rightnote">A strange kind of superstitious deuotion, if this report of
our author be true.</span>
from him, and therewith a heare cloth to be put vpon him, and after
tieng a cord about his necke, he said vnto the bishops and other that
stood by him; "I deliuer my selfe an vnworthie and greeuous sinner vnto
you the ministers of God by this cord, bes&eacute;eching our Lord Jesus Christ,
which pardoned the th&eacute;efe confessing his faults on the crosse, that
through your praiers and for his great mercies sake it may please him to
be mercifull vnto my soule;" wherevnto they all answered, "Amen." Then
<span class="rightnote">He is drawne out of his bed, a thing vnlike to be true.</span>
he said vnto them, "Draw me out of this bed with this cord, and laie me
on that bed strawed with ashes" (which he had of purpose prepared) and
as he commanded so they did: and they laid at his feet and at his head
two great square stones. Thus being prepared to die, he willed his bodie
after his deceasse to be conueied into Normandie, and buried at Rouen.
<span class="rightnote">His death.</span>
And so after he had receiued the sacrament of the bodie and bloud of our
Lord, he departed this life as afore is said, about the 28. yeare of his
age.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
His bodie after his death was conueied towards Rouen, there to be buried
accordinglie as he had willed: but when those that had charge to conueie
it thither were come vnto the citie of Mauns, the bishop there and the
cleargie would not suffer them to go any further with it, but committed
it to buriall in honourable wise within the church of saint Julian.
Whereof when the citizens of Rouen were aduertised, they were sore
offended with that dooing, and streightwaies sent vnto them of Mauns,
requiring to haue the corps deliuered, threatening otherwise with manie
earnest oths to fetch it from them by force. Wherefore king Henrie, to
set order in this matter, commanded that the corps of his sonne the king
should be deliuered vnto them of Rouen to be buried in their citie, as
he himselfe had willed before his death. And so it was taken vp and
<span class="rightnote">The bodie of the yong king lastlie buried at Rouen.</span>
conueied to Rouen, where it was eftsoones buried in the church of our
ladie.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Thus ended this yoong king in his floorishing youth, to whome through
his owne iust deserts long life was iustlie denied, sith he delighted to
begin his gouernement with vnlawfull attempts, as an other Absolon
against his owne naturall father, seeking by wrongfull violence to pull
the scepter out of his hand. He is not put in the number of kings,
bicause he remained for the more part vnder the gouernance of his
father, so that he rather bare the name of king as appointed to reigne,
than that he may be said to haue reigned in d&eacute;ed. So that h&eacute;ere by the
waie a notable obseruation dooth occurre and offer it selfe to be noted
of vs; namelie, that euen princes children, though borne to great
excellencie, and in high degree of dignitie, are to consider with
themselues, that notwithstanding their statelie titles of souereigntie,
they haue a dutie to discharge vnto their parents, which if it be
neglected, and that in place thereof disobedience is substituted, God
himselfe (when politike lawes prouide not to punish such offenses) will
take the cause in hand, &amp; will powre vengeance vpon such vngratious
children. For he will be true of his word both in blessing and curssing,
in blessing the dutifull child with long life and happie daies, and in
curssing the obstinate and froward with short life and vnfortunate
daies, according to the tenure of his law. If this man had liued in the
old Romans time, when aged persons were so reuerenced and honoured (much
more parents) he had beene cut off in the prime of his disobedience, and
present death had beene inflicted vpon him as a due and deserued reward;
which Iuuenal noteth excellentlie well in these words,</p>

<p>King Henrie (after his sonne the king was thus dead) inforced his power
<span class="rightnote">Limoges rendred to king Henrie.</span>
more earnestlie than before to winne the citie and castell of Limoges
which he had besieged, and at length had them both surrendered into his
hands, with all other castels and places of strength kept by his enimies
in those parts, of the which some he furnished with garisons, and some
he caused to be laied flat with the ground.</p>

<p>There rose about the same time occasion of strife and variance betwixt
King Henrie and the French king, about the enioieng of the countrie
<span class="rightnote">Veulquesine.</span>
lieng vpon Gisors, called Veulquesine, on this side the riuer of Hept,
which was giuen vnto king Henrie the sonne, in consideration of the
marriage betwixt him and queene Margaret the French kings sister. For
the French king now after the death of his brother in law king Henrie
the sonne, required to haue the same restored vnto the crowne of France:
but king Henrie was not willing to part with it. At length they met
<span class="rightnote">The kings of England and France talke togither.</span>
betwixt Trie and Gisors to talke of the matter, where they agr&eacute;ed that
qu&eacute;ene Margaret the widow of the late deceased king Henrie the son,
should receiue yearelie<a name="FNanchor_5_12" id="FNanchor_5_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> during hir life 1750 pounds of Aniouin monie at
Paris, of king Henrie the father and his heires; in consideration
whereof she should release and quit claime all hir right to those lands
that were demanded, as Veulquesine and others. Shortlie after, Geffrey
erle of Britaine came to his father, and submitting himselfe, was
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;30.</span>
reconciled to him, and also to his brother Richard earle of Poictow.
Also I find that king Henrie at an enteruiew had betwixt him and the
French king at their accustomed place of meeting betwixt Trie and Gisors
on saint Nicholas day, did his homage to the same French king for the
lands which he held of him on that side the sea, which to doo till then
he had refused. The same yeare king Henrie held his Christmas at the
citie of Mauns.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1184.</span>
When the king had set the French king and the earle of Flanders at
agr&eacute;ement for the controuersie that chanced betwixt them about the lands
of Vermendois, he passed through the earle of Flanders countrie, and
comming to Wisand, tooke ship and sailed ouer into England, landing at

<span class="rightnote">The archbish. of Colen.</span>
And whereas the archbishop of Colen came ouer into England this yeare to

trauelled to make an agr&eacute;ement betwixt him and the Saxonish duke
touching a certeine variance depending betwixt them, wherin the king did
so much, that the archbishop forgaue all iniuries past, and so they were
made fr&eacute;ends. Also by the counsell of the same archbishop the king sent

Hugh Nouant archdeacon of Liseux and others, ambassadours from him vnto
pope Lucius, that by his helpe there might be made some waie to obteine
a pardon for the said duke, and licence for him to returne into his

dooing their message, that the emperour comming where the pope then was,
that is to say, at Verona in Italie, at the earnest suit of the said

Diceto saith) bicause the said Simon died without issue, the king gaue
the earledome of Huntington vnto William king of Scots sonne to earle

yeare, and

Thomas Fitz Bernard lord ch&eacute;efe iustice of the forests,
which roome Alaine de Neuill had inioied before him. Now after the death
<span class="rightnote">The gouernement of the forests diuided.</span>
of this Thomas Fitz Bernard, the king diuided his forests into sundrie
quarters, and to euerie quarter he appointed foure iustices, two of the
spiritualtie, and two knights of the temporaltie, beside two generall
wardens that were of his owne seruants, to be as surueiers aboue all
other foresters of vert and venison, whose office was to s&eacute;e that no
disorder nor spoile were committed within any grounds of warren
contrarie to the assises of forests. Diuerse prelates died this yeare
also, as foure bishops, to wit, Gerald surnamed la Pucelle bishop of
Chester, Walran bishop of Rochester, Joceline of Salisburie, and
Bartholomew of Excester.</p>

<p>Besides these, diuerse abbats, &amp; on the 16. of Februarie died Richard
archbishop of Canturburie in the 11. yeare after his first entring into
the gouernment of that s&eacute;e. His bodie was buried at Canturburie. He was
noted to be a man of euill life, and wasted the goods of that church
inordinatlie. It was reported that before his death there appeared to
him a vision, which said; "Thou hast wasted the goods of the church, and
I shall root th&eacute;e out of the earth." Wherevpon he tooke such a feare,
that he died within eight daies after. Then Baldwin who before was
bishop of Worcester succ&eacute;eded him, he was the 40. archbishop that had
ruled the church of Canturburie. The king and bishops procured his
election not without much adoo: for the moonks pretending a right
thereto, were sore against it. It is reported of him, that after he was
made a white moonke, he neuer eat flesh to his liues end. On a time an
old woman met him, and asked him if it were true that he neuer eat any
maner of flesh; "It is true said he." "It is false quoth she, for I had
but one cow to find me with, and thy seruants haue taken hir from me."
Wherevnto he answered, "that if it so were, she should haue as good a
cow restored to hir by Gods grace, as hir owne was." The same time also
Margaret the wife of the late deceased king Henrie the son, returned
into France to hir brother king Philip, and was after ioined in marriage
with Bela king of Hungarie.</p>

<p>But after long digression to returne againe to our purpose. The king
being aduertised of the destruction and spoile which the Welshmen dailie
did practise against his subiects, both in their persons and substance,
assembled a mightie armie, and came with the same vnto Worcester,
meaning to inuade the enimies countries. But R&eacute;es ap Griffin fearing his
puissance thus bent against him and other the leaders of the Welshmen,
came by safeconduct vnto Worcester, and there submitting himselfe, sware
fealtie to the king, and became his liegeman, promising to bring his
sonne and nephues vnto him as pledges. But when (according to his
promise) he would haue brought them, they refused to go with him, and so
the matter rested for a time.</p>

<p>After this, king Henrie held his Christmasse at Windsore, and the same
yeare Heraclius the patriarch of Jerusalem, and Roger master of the
house of S. Johns of Jerusalem came into England, to make suit vnto king
<span class="rightnote">Heraclius patriarch of Jerusalem.</span>
Henrie for aid against the Saracens that dailie wan from the christians,
townes and holds in the holie land, taking and killing the people most
miserablie, as in the description of the holie land may more plainelie
appeare, where the dooings of Saladine the Saracen are touched. The
patriarch made earnest request vnto the king, proffering him the keies
of the citie of Jerusalem, and of the holie sepulchre (with the letters
of Lucius the third then pope of Rome) charging him to take vpon him the
iournie, and to haue mind of the oth which before time he had made.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A councell at Clerkenwell.</span>
The king deferred his answer for a time, and calling a councell of his
lords togither at Clerkenwell, on the 15. of Aprill, asked their aduice
in this matter: who declared to him, that as they tooke it, he might not
well depart so far out of his realme and other dominions, leauing the
same as a prey to his enimies. And whereas it was thought by some, that
he might appoint one of his sonnes to take vpon that iournie, yet
bicause they were not as then within the realme, it was iudged that in
their absence there was no why it should be so decr&eacute;ed.</p>

<span class="rightnote">Baldwin archbishop of Canturburie exhorteth men to go to
warre against the Saracens.</span>
Howbeit in the meane time vpon licence granted by the king, that so
manie might go as would, Baldwin the archbishop of Canturburie preached,
and exhorted men to take vpon him the crosse so effectuallie, that a
great number receiuing it, fullie purposed to go on in that iournie. At
length the king gaue answer to the patriarch, excusing himselfe in that
he could go, for he declared that he might not leaue his land without
keeping, being in danger to remaine as a prey to the robberie and spoile
<span class="rightnote">Fiue thousand marks saith <i>Geru.&nbsp;Dor.</i> <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i></span>
of the French men: but he offered to giue large summes of gold and
siluer to such as would take vpon them that voiage. With this answer the
cardinall was nothing pleased, and therefore said: "We s&eacute;eke a man and
not monie: euerie christian region well neere sendeth vs monie, but no
countrie sendeth vs a prince; and therfore we require a prince that
n&eacute;edeth monie, and not monie that needeth a prince." But the king still
alledged matter for his excuse, so that the patriarch departed from him
comfortlesse, and greatlie discontented in his mind: whereof the king
hauing knowledge, and intending somewhat to recomfort him with sweet and
pleasant words, followed him to the sea side. But the more the king
thought to satisfie the patriarch with words, the more wroth and
discontented he shewed himselfe to be; in so much that at the last he
<span class="rightnote">The words of the patriarch to the king.</span>
said vnto him, "Hitherto hast thou reigned gloriouslie, but hereafter
shall thou be forsaken of him, whom thou at this time forsakest.
Consider of him, and remember what he hath giuen th&eacute;e, and what thou
hast y&eacute;elded to him againe, how first thou wast false to the king of
France, and after sluedst archbishop Becket, and now lastlie thou
forsakest the protection of Christes faith."</p>

<p>The king was stirred with these words, and said vnto the patriarch,
"Though all the men of the land were one bodie, and spake with one
mouth, they durst not vtter such words against me." "No woonder (said
the patriarch) for they loue thine and not th&eacute;e; that is to say, they
loue thy temporall goods, and stand in feare of th&eacute;e for losse of
promotion, but thy soule they loue not." And when he had so said, he
offered his head to the king; saieng, "Doo by me euen as thou diddest by
archbishop Becket, for all is one to me, either to be slaine heere in
Europe of a wicked christian, or in the holie land by a Saracen, for
thou art woorse than a Saracen, and thy people follow the prey and
spoile and not a man." The king kept his patience, and said, "I may not
go out of my land, for if I should, mine owne sonnes would rise and
rebell against me." "No maruell (said the patriarch) for of the diuell
they came, and to the diuell they shall." And thus he departed from the
<span class="rightnote">Rash iudgement in an holie father.</span>
king in great displeasure. &para;&nbsp;Thus haue some written: but by others it
appeareth that the patriarch remained here till the king went ouer into
Normandie himselfe, in companie of whom the patriarch went also (as
after shall appear.)</p>

made him king. At his comming into Ireland, he was honourablie receiued

<p class="nogap">keeping it in his coffers (as one now come into a strange place, and not
knowing what he shuld want) would not depart with it so fr&eacute;elie amongst
his souldiers and men of warre as they looked for: by reason whereof

On the mondaie in the w&eacute;eke before Easter, chanced a sore earthquake
thorough all the parts of this land, such a one as the like had not

that laie couched fast in the earth, were remooued
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" ></a>

<span class="rightnote">The king and the patriarch passe ouer into France.</span>
The day next after this terrible woonder, the king and the patriarch

realme, passed the seas from Douer to Wissand, and so rode foorth
towards Normandie, where immediatlie vpon his comming thither he raised
<span class="rightnote">The kings message to his sonne earle Richard.</span>
a power, and sent word to his sonne Richard earle of Poictou (which had
fortified the townes and castels of Poictou against him, and taken his

hands the whole countrie of Poictou, he would surelie come to chastise
him with an iron rod, and bring him vnder obedience smallie to his ease.
<span class="rightnote">Erle Richard obeieth his father.</span>
Vpon this message earle Richard being somewhat better aduised, obeied
his fathers commandements in all points, rendring vp into his mothers
hands the earldome of Poictou, and comming to his father as an obedient
sonne, shewed himselfe readie to serue him at commandement with a glad

day, the sunne suffered a generall eclipse, so that no part of it
appeared, and therewith followed great thunder with lightning and sore
tempest, with the violence whereof both men and beasts were destroied,
and manie houses burned.</p>

<p>Shortlie after this the kings of England and France met and communed
togither for the aiding of them in the holie land, and they promised
ind&eacute;ed to send thither both men and monie: but the patriarch made small
account thereof, for he was much deceiued of that which he hoped to haue
brought to passe, which was, either to haue got the king of England, or
one of his sonnes, or some other man of great authoritie with him into
the holie land: but bicause that would not be, he departed from the
court verie sorrowfull and sore displeased, so that it may be thought,
that then (and not before his departure out of England) he spake his
mind so plainlie vnto the king (as before yee haue heard.)</p>

<p>

Moreouer, about this time king Henrie obteined of pope Vrbane the third,
that he might crowne which of his sonnes it should please him king of

vnto him a crowne of peacocks feathers, after a feat maner wouen in with

<span class="yearnote">1186.</span>
This yeare the king held his Christmasse at Danfrount, and shortlie
after came to a communication with the French king, at the which he
tooke a solemne oth that he would deliuer the ladie Alice the French
kings sister (whome he had as yet in his custodie) vnto his sonne
Richard erle of Poictou in mariage. For the which mariage to be had and
solemnized, the French king granted to deliuer vnto the said Richard the
towne of Gisors, with all that which his father king Lewes promised vnto
king Henrie the sonne (latelie deceassed) in marriage with qu&eacute;ene
Margaret the wife of the same Henrie, receiuing an oth thereto, neuer to

<span class="rightnote">King Henrie returneth into England. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i>
Hugh prior of Witham made bishop of Lincolne.</span>
King Henrie (after he had thus concluded and finished his affaires with
the French king) returned backe into England in Maie, and then was Hugh
prior of Witham instituted bishop of Lincolne after that the see there
had b&eacute;ene void and without any lawfull gouernour almost the space of
seauenteene yeares. This Hugh was reputed a verie godlie and vertuous
man. Before him Walter Constance was nominated to that s&eacute;e, but bicause
he was made archbishop of Rouen before he was inuested in the church of
Lincolne, he is not accounted in number of the bishops of Lincolne.</p>

<p>Moreouer king Henrie shortlie after his returne at this time into
England, assembled a great armie, and went with the same to Caerleill,
in purpose to haue entred Galloway, and there to haue chastised Rouland
lord of that countrie, who was sonne to Uthred the sonne of Fergus, for
the iniuries doone to his coosine germains, namelie to Duncane sonne to
Gilbert, who was sonne to the same Fergus, in spoiling him and the
residue (after the deceasse of the said Gilbert) of their parts of
inheritance, vsurping the whole to himselfe. But as the king was now
readie to inuade his countrie, Rouland came to
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
him, and vsed such
meanes vnder pretense of satisfaction, that he made his peace with the
king, who therevpon brought backe his armie, and did no more at that

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Hugh Lacie slaine.</span>
About the same time came newes to the king, that Hugh Lacie was slaine
in Ireland by an Irish gentleman that was his confederate (or rather by
a labourer, as in the Irish historie you may read) whereof the king was
nothing sorie, bicause the same Hugh was growne to so high degr&eacute;e of
puissance in that countrie, that he refused to obeie the kings
commandement when he sent for him.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;It is to be noted, that when king Henrie had conquered the most part
of Ireland, and set the countrie in some good order, and after his
comming from thence, such capteines as he left there behind him, were
not idle, but still did what they could to inlarge the confines which
were committed to their gouernance: but amongst them all this Hugh Lacie
<span class="rightnote">Hugh Lacies diligence to inlarge his possessions in Ireland.</span>
was the ch&eacute;efest, in somuch that after the death of Richard earle of
Striguile, the king made him gouernour of the countrie in place of the
said earle, by reason whereof he so inlarged his possessions, that
within a while he became dreadfull, not onelie to the enimies, but also
to his associats, as to such English capteins as were abiding in Ireland
vpon gard of the English frontiers. For if any of them disobeied his
commandement, he would not sticke to chastise them at his pleasure, so
that by such meanes he seemed rather to conquer the countrie to his owne
vse, than to the kings. Wherein he dealt not so directlie or discr&eacute;etlie
as he might; for,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Homines volunt allici non impelli.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had also ioined himselfe in mariage with a daughter of the king of
Unlester, not making king Henrie priuie to the same. Wherevpon the king
hauing sundrie informations presented to him of such his presumptuous
demeanour, commanded him by his letters to returne home, and come before
his presence, which to doo (as before I haue said) he refused, by reason
whereof he confirmed the suspicion which was conceiued of him, to rise
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie not sorie for the death of Lacie.</span>
vpon no vaine coniectures, and therefore the euill that came to him was
nothing lamented of king Henrie, who with good cause was highlie

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The death of Geffrey the kings sonne.</span>
This yeare Geffrey the kings son who was earle of Britaine died at

daughters) one onlie sonne as then in his mothers wombe, of whom she was
deliuered in the night of the feast of Easter next insuing hir husband's
death: he was named Arthur, and succeeded his father in the earledome of
Britaine. His fathers death was occasioned (as men iudge) by a fall
which he caught at a iournie, for he was sore bruised therewith, and
neuer had his health, but finallie fell into a flix and so died.</p>

<p>About this season pope Vrbane wrote vnto Baldwin archbishop of
Canturburie, granting him licence to build a church at Alkinton, in
honour of S. Stephan and Thomas Becket now reputed a martyr, and that
the fourth part of the offerings which came to the box of Thomas the
martyr should be assigned to the vse of the moonks, &amp; an other fourth
part to the buildings of that church, and an other fourth part to be
giuen to the poore, and the other fourth part remaining he might reserue
to himselfe to bestow at his pleasure. But within a while after, at the
suit and supplication of the prior and couent of Canturburie (who liked
nothing of the former partition) the pope sent letters of prohibition to
the said archbishop, that he should ceasse from building of the fore
mentioned church, bicause the building thereof would be preiudiciall to

About the same time also king Henrie gaue his coosen the ladie Ermengard
(who was daughter to Richard Vicount Beaumont) in marriage vnto Willam
king of Scotland, causing the archbishop of Canturburie to ioine them
togither in the bond of matrimonie within the chappell at Woodstocke,

<p>The French king required to haue the custodie of the infant Arthur,
heire to Geffrey earle of Britaine: but king Henrie would in no wise
<span class="rightnote">Ambassadours sent to the French king.</span>
grant thereto. Wherefore he sent Walter archbishop of Rouen, William de
Mandeuille earle of Albemarle, and Ranulfe de Glandeuille lord cheefe
iustice of England to the French court, to talke with king Philip about
that matter, so that king Philip hauing heard them, was contented to
staie from attempting force till the feast of S. Hilarie. But in the
<span class="rightnote">Sir William de Walles.</span>
meane time it chanced, that one sir Richard de Walles a knight of the
realme of France went about to fortifie a castell in a village that
belonged to him called Walles, situated betwixt Trie &amp; Gisors. Wherevpon
Henrie Vere (constable of Gisors vnder William earle of Albemarle) was
nothing content therwith, and therefore got a companie togither, &amp; went
foorth to disturbe the worke. Vpon this occasion the seruants of the
said sir Richard de Walles came foorth, and encountred with him in the
field, in somuch that Rafe the sonne of sir Richard de Walles was
slaine, and the residue that were with him fled, many of them being sore
beaten and wounded.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The king of Englands subiects arested in Fr&#257;ce.</span>
When the French king was informed hereof, he caused all the kings of
England his subiects, that could be found within his countries and
dominion of France to be apprehended, and their goods seized. The
stewards, bailifes, &amp; officers then of king Henrie, did the like by the
<span class="rightnote">The French subiects arested in Normandie.</span>
French kings subiects that chanced to be at that present within the king
of Englands countries, on that further side of the sea. But within a
little while after, the French king set the English subiects at
libertie, and so likewise did the K. of Englands officers release the
French subiects.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;33. <br />

At this time king Henrie held his Christmasse at Gilford, and shortlie
<span class="rightnote">Octauianus a cardinall.</span>
after came one Octauianus a subdeacon cardinall, and Hugh de Nouant from
the court of Rome, sent as legats from pope Vrbane into Ireland, that
they might crowne earle John the kings sonne king of that land. But king
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie passeth ouer into Normandie.</span>
Henrie made a delaie therein, taking the legats with him into Normandie,
whither he sailed at the same time, and landing at Wissand, he went from
thence into Normandie, and shortlie after came to a communication with
the French king, at a place called Vadum Sancti Remigij where after much
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
talke they could not agr&eacute;e, by reason the French king demanded things
vnreasonable, and so they departed without any thing concluded [sauing a
truce] till after Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Jerusalem taken.</span>
About the same time, the citie of Jerusalem was taken by Saladine the
ch&eacute;efe prince of the Saracens. Wherevpon much conference was had among
the christian princes for the succoring of those christians, which as
yet held and defended other p&eacute;eces in the holie land, so that by
publishing of the popes buls, manie tooke on them the crosse: and
amongst other Richard the sonne of king Henrie (without anie licence
obteined of his father) receiued the same, vowing to go thither out of
hand, and to fight against Gods enimies to the vttermost of his power.</p>

<p>In the meane time the grudge still increased betwixt king Henrie and
Philip the French king, partlie for one cause, and partlie for an other,
<span class="rightnote">Out of the annales of France written by Nicoll Gallis.</span>
but speciallie one cheefe occasion was for that earle Richard deferred
the dooings of his homage vnto king Philip for the dutchie of Poictou,
which by his fathers appointment he now inioied and held. The French
king to preuent his enimies, immediatlie vpon the expiring of the truce
raised a power, and entring into the dominions belonging to king Henrie,
wasted the countrie till he came vnto Chateu Raoul: about which castell
also he foorthwith planted his siege.</p>

<p>When king Henrie was aduertised hereof, he raised his power also, and
togither with his sonne earle Richard came with all sp&eacute;ed to succour his
people, and to saue his castell from the hands of his enimies. Now when
he approched n&eacute;ere vnto the place, he pitcht downe his tents ouer
against the one side of the French campe, and earle Richard on the
other, so that they were readie to assaile the French king on both sides
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
at once, but before they came to ioine battell, by the mediation of a
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
cardinall (as some write) or (as other saie) through meanes made by the
earle of Flanders, the matter was taken vp. For earle Richard through
persuasion of the said earle of Flanders came to the French king, and
agr&eacute;ed with him, before that his father king Henrie was resolued of any
such matter for his part, so that he was now in a maruellous
perplexitie, &amp; almost to s&eacute;eke what was best to doo, as a man fearing
his owne suertie, by reason of mistrust which he had in his sonne
Richard; but yet at the length through humble suit made by his said
<span class="rightnote">A truce granted.</span>
sonne vnto the French king, a truce was granted by the space of two
yeares.</p>

<p>Earle Richard, after the matter was thus taken vp, went into France with
the French king, of whom he was so honoured whilest he was there, that
they kept one table at dinner and supper in the daie time, and was (as
was said) one bed serued them both to sl&eacute;epe on in the night.</p>

<p>In the meane time king Henrie hearing of all this, fell into great
suspicion whereto this great familiaritie betwixt the French king and
his sonne would tend, and doubting the likeliest, sent for him to
<span class="rightnote">Erle Richard giueth his father faire words.</span>
returne vnto him. But earle Richard perceiuing his father to mistrust
his loialtie, gaue faire words, and promised to returne with all
conuenient sp&eacute;ed. Howbeit he ment an other matter, and so departing from
<span class="rightnote">He seizeth vpon his fathers treasure.</span>
the French court, came to Chinon, where he got into his hands a great
portion of his fathers treasure that was kept there, against the will of
him that had the custodie of it, and taking it thus awaie with him, he
began to fortifie his castels and townes within his countrie of Poictou,
and clearlie refused to come backe to his father for a time, although at
length forsaking the counsell of naughtie men, he turned home vnto him,
and humblie submitted himselfe, in such wise as to his dutie
apperteined. And for the more assurance therof, he renewed his fealtie,
in receiuing an oth vpon the holie euangelists. Which doone, king Henrie
went into Britaine with an armie, and woone the castell of Mountreleis
by siege, which one Henrie de Lions, and one Guinemer his brother had
gotten into their hands, after the deceasse of Geffrey earle of
Britaine.</p>

<p>This yeare the twentie of October, the citie of Chichester was almost
wholie consumed to ashes by mischance of fire. The head church with the
bishops palace, and the houses of the canons were burnt euen downe to

the ground. After this king Henrie held his Christmasse at Caen, from
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie returneth into England.</span>
whence he went to Harfleet, and there taking the sea passed ouer into
England. The French king hearing by and by of his departure, assembled a
great armie, and threatned to destroie the countrie of Normandie, and
other lands on that side the sea, except king Henrie would deliuer into
his hands the towne of Gisors, with the appurtenances, or cause his
sonne Richard earle of Poictou to take to wife his sister Alice,
according to his promise.</p>

<p>

Heauie newes from the east parts.</span>
When king Henrie was aduertised hereof, he turned with all speed into
Normandie, that he might prouide for timelie resistance, if the French
king came forward to inuade his dominions. About the selfe same time
came newes out of the holie land, that Saladine after the winning of
Jerusalem, pursued his victorie with such successe, that he had taken
from the christians the more part of all other towns and strengths
within the land. These newes were nothing pleasant to the christian
princes, and namelie the two kings Henrie and Philip seemed sorowfull
for the same, and therefore came to an enterview togither on the 21. day
<span class="rightnote">An enteruiew betwixt the two kings.</span>
of Januarie betwixt Trie and Gisors, where the archbishop of Tire was
present through whose earnest exhortation the two kings were made

freends, and the same day receiued the crosse at his hands in purpose to
make a iourneie togither against those Saracens that had doone such
iniuries to the christian name. And for a difference that one nation
might be knowne from an other, the French king and his people tooke vpon
them to weare read crosses, the king of England and his subiects white
crosses: but the earle of Flanders and his men ware gr&eacute;ene.</p>

<p>Herewith they departed asunder, each one repairing to their countries to
prouide their armies, and make them in readinesse to set forward by a
day towards this necessarie
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
iournie. King Henrie comming to Chinon, by
<span class="rightnote">An aid granted to them in the Holie Land. <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
aduise of his councell, ordeined that euerie one of his subiects should
yeeld a tenth part of his reuenues and mooueable goods for that yeare
towards the aid of them in the holie land (corne of that yeares growth
excepted, and also all armour, horsses, bookes, apparell, ornaments of
chappels, and pretious stones, which should not come in the rate of
goods now taxed, nor be charged with this paiment.) Moreouer those
knights and men of warre that were appointed to go in this iourneie
paied nothing, but had that monie also towards their furniture, which
were gathered of their tenants and farmers, howbeit burgesses and others
that tooke vpon them the crosse without license of their lords, paied
his tenth, so that none of them went free.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Good orders and discipline instituted.</span>
There were also good orders deuised, both for the aduancement of Gods
glorie, and the releefe of the common-wealth, as that no man should
sweare in any outragious maner, that no man should plaie at cards, dice
or tables, and that no maner of person after Easter should weare any
costlie furs or cloth of scarlet, nor that men should vse to haue their
tables serued with more than two dishes of meat at one meale, nor should
haue their apparell cut, iagged, or laced: and further, that none of
them should take any women foorth with them in this iourneie, except
such a landresse, of whome there might not growe anie suspicion of
wanton life. It was also ordeined, that the monie of such as died in
this iournie, should go towards the finding and maintenance of their
seruants and of poore people, and towards the aid of the christians in
the holie land. Moreouer, the pope granted that all those that went
foorth in this iournie, repenting and confessing their sinnes, should be
<span class="rightnote">The king returneth into England.</span>
absolued and pardoned of the same. The king hauing thus taken for his
businesse in the parts on the further side the sea, came now ouer into
England againe, landing at Winchelsey on a Saturday the thirtith day of
<span class="rightnote">A council holden at Gaitington. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
Januarie, and calling a councell togither at Gaitington, which is eight
or nine miles from Northampton, he there declared what orders he had
taken for his iournie into the holie land. Wherevpon the bishops of
Norwich and Lincolne, and a great number of other people tooke vpon them
the crosse at the preaching of the archbishop of Canturburie, and the
bishop of Rochester.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A tenth leuied.</span>
This doone, king Henrie tooke order also for the leuieng of the tenth,
as well here in England, as he had doone in the parts subiect to him on
the further side the sea. He also sent Hugh bishop of Durham, and other
both spirituall and temporall persons, vnto William king of Scots, to
gather the tenth likewise within his countrie, but he met them betwixt
<span class="rightnote">The king of Scots.</span>
Wark and Brightham, and would not suffer them to enter into Scotland,
but he offered to giue vnto the king of England in recompense of the
tenths, and for to haue againe his castels, the summe of 5000. marks of
siluer, which could not be accepted. The French king likewise gathered
the tenths in his countrie towards this intended iournie. But by the
<span class="rightnote">The good meaning of the two kings disappointed. <i>Polydor.</i></span>
working of some wicked spirit (as we may well thinke) which enuied the
aduancement or the christian common-wealth, that good meaning of the two
kings was broken and disappointed: for the peace latelie concluded
betwixt them continued not long vnuiolated.</p>

<p>The French writers impute the fault thereof vnto English men, and the
English writers laie it to French men. The French writers say, that
earle Richard the son of king Henrie in breach of the league, made warre
<span class="rightnote">Reimond earle of Tholouze.</span>
vpon Reimond earle of Tholouze. The English writers reproue the French
king as a wicked man, in that he should of purpose breake the peace and
moue warre against king Heurie, to withdraw him from going to make warre
against the Saracens, to the which enterprise, he was wholie bent and
inclined. Such is the maner of manie writers, who more affectionat to
the loue of their countrie than to the truth, doo not obserue the law of
histories in their writings, but rather inueie one against another in a
bralling and reprouing maner.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;Examples hereof are more than by any possibilitie may be remembred,
and namelie for breuitie sake George Bucchanan in the 8. booke of his

In deed (as Roger Houeden and other doo witnes) the foresaid earle
Reimond, and also Aimer earle of Angolesme, Geffrey de Racon, and
Geffrey de Lusignan, with the most part of all the nobles of Poictou,
made warre against earle Richard, and he held tacke against them all,
and in the end ouercame them. Amongst other of earle Reimonds part whom

taken diuerse merchants of Poictou that were subiects to earle Richard,
&amp; doone manie other displeasures to him and to his countrie, wherefore
earle Richard kept this Peter in verie close prison, and would not put
him to his ransome: in somuch that earle Reimond tooke two of the king
of Englands knights, sir Robert Poer, and sir Richard Fraser, as they
were returning from Compostella, where they had b&eacute;ene to visit the bodie
of S. James, but they were quicklie set at libertie by the French kings

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Erle Richard inuadeth the earle Tholouze lands.</span>
After this, earle Richard entred with a great armie into the lands of
earle Reimond, wasted the same, and tooke by siege a castell of his

hearing, sent out of hand to the king of England, requiring to know if
the damages doone by his sonne earle Richard vnto him &amp; his people in
Tholouze, were doone by his commandement, for the which he demanded
restitution. Herevnto the king of England answered, that his sonne earle
Richard did nothing in that behalfe, either by his knowledge or
commandement: but that as he had signified to him by the archbishop of
Dublin, what soeuer he did therin, was doone by the counsell of the
French king himselfe.</p>

<p>Howsoeuer this matter went, certeine it is, that king Philip taking
<span class="rightnote">Annales de France.</span>
weapon in hand, vpon a sudden entred into Berrie, and tooke from king
Henrie Chasteau Raoull, Brezancois, Argenton, Mountrichard, Mountresor,
Vandosme, Leprose, Blanc en Berrie, Culan and Molignon. Wherfore king
Henrie (who was at this<a name="FNanchor_5_13" id="FNanchor_5_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> time in England about to prepare an armie to go
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The archbishop of Canturburie with the bishops

therewith into the holie land) when he heard thereof, with all sp&eacute;ed he
sent Baldwin archbishop of Canturburie, and Hugh bishop of Durham ouer
into France, to appease the French kings displeasure with courteous
words and reasonable persuasions if it might be: but when that could not
be brought to passe, he sailed ouer into Normandie himselfe, with an
armie of Englishmen and Welshmen, landing with the same at Herflue the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
10. daie of Julie, after he had beene sore tossed by a cruell tempest
that rose as he was on the sea, to the great danger of his person, &amp; all
that were with him.</p>

<p>Now after his comming to land, he repaired vnto Alencon, increasing his
power by gathering vp souldiers and men of warre out of Normandie and
<span class="rightnote">Chateau Roux it is called in the French annales: but y<sup>e</sup>
chronicles of Aniou name it Chasteau Raoul, and rightlie as I thinke.</span>
other his countries on that side the sea. In the meane time his sonne
Richard earle of Poictou entred into Berrie with a mightie armie, and
the French king deliuering Chateau Raoull vnto the keeping of sir
William de Berres returned into France, so that earle Richard spoiled
and wasted the lands of those earls and barons which tooke the French
part exceedinglie. The French king kept him as yet within France, and
durst not come foorth now after the ariuall of king Henrie, but manie
enterprises were atchiued by the capteines on both sides. Philip bishop
of Beauuois inuading the frontiers of Normandie, burned Blangeuille,
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
belonging to the earle of Augi, and the castell Albemarle (that belonged
to William de Mandeuille, whereof he bare the title of earle) and wasted
the countrie round about. The French king also came to the towne of
Trow, and burned it, and tooke 40. men of armes there, but the castell
he could not win. On the other part, Richard earle of Poictou tooke a
<span class="rightnote">Sergeants.</span>
strong place called Les Roches, beyond Trow towards Vandosme, with 25.
men of armes, and 60. yeomen.</p>

<p>About this time king Henrie sent ambassadours vnto the French king, as
Walter the archbishop of Rouen, John bishop of Eureux, and William
Marshall, to require restitution for the damages doone to him and his
people. And furthermore, that if the French king refused to make
restitution, then had they in commandement to declare defiance against
him. Wherevnto the French king answered, that he would not giue ouer to
make warre till he had Berrie, and the countrie of Veuxin or Veulgesine
wholie in his possession. Wherefore king Henrie with a mightie armie (on
the tuesdaie after the feast of the decollation of S. John) entred into
the realme of France, and burned manie townes and villages, approching
the same day n&eacute;ere to the towne of Maunt, where the French king was
thought to be. Now as it chanced, William de Berres and Drogo de Merlo
encountred with Richard earle of Poictou and William de Mandeuille earle
of Albemarle, so that William de Berres was taken by earle Richard, but
by negligence of them that should haue taken h&eacute;ed to him, escaped awaie
vpon his pages horsse. The morrow after also, earle Richard departed
<span class="rightnote">The Welshmen.</span>
from his father towards Berrie, and vpon the thursdaie the Welshmen
burned manie villages, with the castell of Danuille that belonged to
Simon Daneth, and tooke manie rich preies and booties. Also William
Mandeuille earle of Albemarle burned a place called saint Clare, that
was belonging vnto the demaine of the French king.</p>

<p>But see, when the English were fullie bent to prosecute the warres (with
all extremitie) now in hand, there came messengers vnto king Henrie from
the French king, requiring him that he would grant a peace to be had
betwixt them, with promise that if he would condescend therevnto, that
he should receiue by waie of restitution all that the French king had
<span class="rightnote">The two kings come to a treatie.</span>
now taken from him in Berrie. Herevpon they came to a communication
betwixt Trie &amp; Gisors, and when they could not agr&eacute;e, the French king
caused a great elme standing betwixt those two places to be cut downe,
<span class="rightnote">An elme cut downe.</span>
at which the kings of England and France were accustomed to m&eacute;et when
they treated of matters in controuersie betwixt them, swearing that from
thencefoorth there should neuer be anie more m&eacute;etings holden at that
place.</p>

<p>Afterward, when the earle of Flanders and the earle of Blois with
diuerse other earles and barons of the Realme of France, laid their
armor aside, protesting openlie that they would not put on the same
<span class="rightnote">A commendable protestation and worthie to be noted.</span>
againe to make warre against any christian, till they should returne
from their iournie which they had vowed into the holie land, the French
king destitute of men to serue him, made sute once againe to king
Henrie, that they might m&eacute;et and talke of peace, which was hardlie
granted, and so they met on the morrow after saint Faithes daie, or the
<span class="rightnote">Castellium.</span>
seauenth of October, at Chattellon, where they entreated of a forme of
peace, so that the French king should haue restored all that he had
taken within the countries belonging to king Henrie, and likewise
Richard earle of Poictou should deliuer vp vnto the earle of saint Giles
(otherwise called earle of Tholouse) all that he had taken from him
since the breach of the last truce. But when king Henrie would not
deliuer the castell of Pascie in pledge to the French king, they
departed in sunder (as before) without any thing concluded. The king of
France after this tooke the castell of Paluell.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">An other treatie betwixt the two kings.</span>
Vpon the eight&eacute;enth day of August the two kings came againe togither
about a new treatie of peace betwixt Bonsemblance and Sukennie, where
the French king offered king Henrie, to restore to him all that he had
taken by his last warres if his sister Alice might be ioined in marriage
with Richard erle of Poictou, now eldest sonne aliue to king
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
Henrie,
and that all king Henries subiects might doo homage and sweare fealtie
to the same Richard. But king Henrie after the old prouerbe, Ictus
piscator sapit, hauing bought his experience with the f&eacute;eling of smart,
&amp; bearing in memorie the iniuries done to him by his sonne Henrie, after
such his aduancement to kinglie degr&eacute;e, would not grant the French kings
request herein. Wherevpon a further mischeefe happened, for his sonne
earle Richard (taking displeasure that his father should denie him that
honour, which made altogither for his more assurance to succeed him as
<span class="rightnote">Erle Richard reuolteth from his father to serue the French
king.</span>
king) fell from his said father manifestlie, and became the French kings
man, dooing homage to him also without consent of king Henrie, for all
those lands that belonged to his said father on that further side the
sea. The French king for his homage and fealtie gaue him Chateau Raoull
and Ysoldun, with all the honour thereto belonging.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
&para;&nbsp;Some write, that the cheefest cause which mooued king Henrie to refuse
to ioine his sonne earle Richard and the ladie Alice, daughter vnto the
French king in marriage togither, was, for that he was linked in the
cumbersome chaine of hot burning loue with the same ladie, and therefore

insomuch that he liked hir so well, that he ment to be diuorsed from his
wife qu&eacute;ene Elianor, and to marrie this yoong ladie, which if he might

verie nice and deintie in making choise of matter pleasing their owne

may as soone offend as it is taken, as a thorne may pricke, or a netle

1189.</span>
King Henrie held his Christmas at Saumur in Aniou, but manie of his
earles and barons were gon from him, and tooke part with the French
king, and with his sonne Richard earle of Poictou. Now when the day was
come, in which the truce expired, the Britains (which had a charter of
couenants of the French king and earle Richard, that
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
if they concluded
any peace with king Henrie, the Britain should be partakers in the same)
entred into the confines of those countries which still continued their
due obedience towards king Henrie; spoiling and wasting the same on each
<span class="rightnote">A legat.</span>
side with barbarous crueltie. At which time also a legat came from the
pope named John de Anagnia, who assaied both by courteous meanes and
also by threats and menacings to reduce the parties vnto peace and
concord: insomuch that by his procurement they met this yeare after
Easter n&eacute;ere vnto Fiert Bernard, twise within a few daies togither, to
trie if by talke they might sort to some reasonable conditions of
agreement.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
The last time of those their meetings was in the Whitsunw&eacute;eke, at what
time the French king required not onelie to haue his sister Alice
deliuered vnto earle Richard for wife, according to the former
couenants, but also some assurance giuen vnto the same earle Richard,
that he should inherit his fathers lands after his deceasse. Also he
required that earle John might take vpon him the crosse to passe ouer
into the holie land also; for otherwise earle Richard would not go.
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Howbeit king Henrie would in no wise consent to any of these demands:
but yet as some write, he offered thus much vnto king Philip, that if he
could be so content, his sonne John should marrie his sister Alice, and
inioy with hir all such things as he demanded in preferment of his sonne
Richard, and that in more large maner than he had requested the same;
But king Philip would none of that.</p>

<p>Thus how soeuer it was, whilest the one demanded that which the other
thought no reason to grant, they departed without concluding any
<span class="rightnote">King Phillip entereth into the countrie of Maine.</span>
agr&eacute;ement, so that king Philip hauing got by this meanes a good occasion
to further his enterprises, with all his whole puissance entred into
Maine, where he destroied a great part of that countrie, and approched
to the citie of Mauns, where king Henrie as then laie, in purpose to
besiege it; But king Henrie being warned of his comming set the suburbs
on fire, bicause his enimies should haue no succour in them. Howbeit the
flame of the fire was by force of the wind driuen so directlie into the
citie, that what with heat and assault of the enimie, the king being
without any store of souldiers to defend it longer, was constreined to
forsake it. Herewith he was so mooued that in departing from the citie,
<span class="rightnote">The words of king Henrie in his displeasure towards earle
Richard.</span>
he said these words of his sonne Richard to himselfe: "Sith thou hast
taken from me this daie the thing that I most loued in this world, I
will requite thee, for after this daie, I shall depriue th&eacute;e of that
thing which in me should most please th&eacute;e, euen mine owne hart."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Mauns y&eacute;elded to the French king. <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
Being thus driuen to leaue the defaced citie of Mauns, he repaired vnto
Chinon, the citizens whereof being left destitute of aid, y&eacute;elded
themselues to the French king, who taking a great pride in his dooings
for that victorie, passed ouer Loire, and wan the citie of Towrs,
wherein he placed a garison, and so hauing sped his businesse with good
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
successe, brought home his armie laden with preies &amp; booties. King
Henrie being thus put to the worsse, and not perceiuing anie readie
meane how to recouer his losses, began to despaire in himselfe, and
therefore of necessitie thought it best to s&eacute;eke for peace, but his suit
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Flanders s&eacute;eketh to agr&eacute;e the parties. <i>Matth.
Paris.</i></span>
was in vaine: for the enimie hauing now the aduantage, would not grant
to agr&eacute;e vpon any reasonable conditions.</p>

<p>At the last Philip the earle of Flanders and William archbishop of
Reimes, with Hugh duke of Burgoine, came to king Henrie to moue waies of
agr&eacute;ement, and to conclude the same betwixt him on the one partie, and
the French king and earle Richard on the other partie. Earle Richard had
the Britaines and them of Poictou confederate with him vnder such
conditions, as he might not agr&eacute;e with his father, vnlesse they might be
<span class="rightnote">A peace concluded.</span>
comprised in the agr&eacute;ement. At length they agreed vpon conditions, not
altogither aduantageable to the king of England, yet in the end, Chateau
Raoul was restored to king Henrie with all that had b&eacute;ene taken from him
since the time that the French king &amp; he tooke vpon them the crosse: on
the other part king Henrie did homage to the French king, which, in the
beginning of this warre he had surrendred and renounced. He was bound
<span class="rightnote">Thirtie thousand to the K. and twentie to the barons of
France, saith <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
also to paie to the French king 20. thousand markes for the aid which
earle Richard
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
had receiued of him: moreouer to resigne and acquite vnto
the French king, all that which either he or his predecessours held or
possessed within Aluergue. Other articles there were which king Henrie
agr&eacute;ed vnto some against his will, as the deliuerie of the ladie Alice
or Adela, and such other, which (as not much materiall) we passe ouer.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> At Gisors saith <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
This peace was concluded not farre from Towrs, in a place appointed
conuenient for both the kings to m&eacute;et in, about the feast of the
apostles Peter and Paule. And (as writers record) there chanced great
thunder and lightening at the verie time when the two kings came to
enteruiew and talke togither, so that the thunderbolt did light betwixt
<span class="rightnote">Strange thunder &amp; lightning.</span>
them two: &amp; yet (notwithstanding such thunder &amp; lightening) the aire was
cleare and nothing troubled. The two kings parted a sunder through feare
thereof for that day, and on the next day the like chance happened,
greatlie to the terrour of them both. Which mooued king Henrie the
sooner to condescend to the agreement.</p>

<p>Moreouer this is not to be forgotten, that when all matters were quieted
and accorded amongst them, King Henrie required to haue all their names
deliuered vnto him in writing, which had promised to take part (and were
ioined as confederates) with the French king and earle Richard. This was
granted, and when the roll was presented vnto him, he found his sonne
John the first person that was named in that register, wherewith he was
so troubled and disquieted in his mind, that comming to Chinon he felt
such gr&eacute;efe hereof, that he curssed euen the verie daie in which he was
borne, and as was said, gaue to his sonnes Gods cursse and his, the
which he would neuer release, although he was admonished to doo it both
of sundrie bishops and other religious and godlie men. Thus saith
Houeden.</p>

<p>Howbeit, it is not like that earle Richard at this time had procured his
brother John to be confederate with him in his rebellious dealings, but
rather bicause earle Richard had some suspicion, least his father would
make John his heire and successour in the kingdome, it might be a
policie wrought by the French king and earle Richard, to alienate his
fathers mind from the said John.</p>

<p>&para;&nbsp;These euils were est&eacute;emed to fall vnto king Henrie by the iust
iudgement of God, for that being admonished diuerse waies, as well by
diuine reuelation, as by the wholesome aduise of graue men, as Hugh
bishop of Lincolne and others, he would not reforme his licentious
appetite of heaping vp sinne vpon sinne, but still wallowed therein to
his owne destruction. Wherevpon being brought to such an extremitie as
ye haue heard, he was taken with a greeuous sicknesse, which bringing
him to vtter desperation of recouering of health, he finallie departed
this life, though more through verie anguish and gr&eacute;efe of his late
losse and troubles susteined, than by the force of his bodilie disease
<span class="rightnote">King Henrie departeth this life.</span>
(as writers haue affirmed.) But howsoeuer it was, he ended his life the
sixt of Julie in the 61. yeare of his age, and after he had reigned 34.
yeares, nine moneths, and two daies, which was in the yeare after the
<span class="yearnote">1189.</span>
birth of our sauiour 1189. and of the creation of the world 5155. His
bodie was buried at Founteuerard, which is an abbeie situate not farre
from the towne of the eagle within the dutchie of Alanson.</p>

<p>Immediatlie vpon his death, those that were about him, applied their
market so busilie in catching and filching awaie things that laie readie
for them, that the kings corps laie naked a longtime, till a child
<span class="rightnote">His surname whereof it came.</span>
couered the nether parts of his body with a short cloke, and then it
s&eacute;emed that his surname was fulfilled that he had from his childhood,
which was Shortmantell, being so called, bicause he was the first that
brought short clokes out of Aniou into England. As his sonne Richard met
the corps going towards the buriall, suddenlie there issued bloud out of
the dead bodies nosthrilles, which was taken for a signification that it
abhorred the presence of so wicked a son, which in his life time had so
persecuted the father. His death was signified by a maruellous strange
<span class="rightnote">A strange maner of fight betwixt fishes.</span>
woonder, for a few daies before he died, all the fishes in a certeine
m&eacute;ere or poole in Normandie, leapt foorth on land in the night season,
and fought togither with such a noise, that a great
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
multitude of men
came running thither to behold the woonder, and could not find on fish
aliue in the meere.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The issue of Henrie the second. His sonnes. His daughters.</span>
He had issue by his wife qu&eacute;ene Elianor (as may appeare by that which
alreadie is rehearsed) foure sonnes, Henrie, Richard, Geffrey, and John,
besides two other that died yoong, as some authors haue recorded: also
three daughters, Maud, married vnto Henrie the duke of Saxonie; Elianor
the wife of Alfonse the eight of that name king of Castile, and Joane
<span class="rightnote">His base sons.</span>
giuen in marriage vnto William king of Sicill. He had also two bastard
sonnes by a concubine, the one named William, &amp; the other Geffrey. He
<span class="rightnote">The constitution of his bodie.</span>
was of bodie fleshie and strong, and could abide verie patientlie the
displesures both of cold and heat, he had a large head, a broad breast,
a broken voice, and was furthermore verie spare of diet, cheefelie
bicause he would not be too fat; and therefore when he was at quiet
without any trouble of warres, he would exercise himselfe in hunting or
<span class="rightnote">His stature.</span>
trauelling abroad. He was of a good stature and verie well-formed, of a
comelie countenance, partlie red heared, with graie eies, of wit quicke,
and of a perfect good memorie, so that he would long remember those
<span class="rightnote">His qualities and conditions of mind.</span>
things which he had either read, heard, or seene. He was stout of
stomach, and more constant in time of aduersitie than in time of
prosperitie, except at the time of his death, when being destitute in
maner of all his fr&eacute;ends, he shewed himselfe almost in despaire. He was
liberall towards all men, oftentimes giuing rewards to his souldiers
ouer and besides their wages.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Radulphus de Diceto.</i></span>
Moreouer, of nature he was pitifull towards the poore, as it well
appeared by diuerse his charitable deeds; as for example. When in the
yeare 1176. there was a great dearth &amp; scarsitie of bread in the parts
of Aniou &amp; Maine, he fed euerie daie with sufficient sustenance ten
thousand persons, from the begining of Aprill, till the time that new
corne was inned: and what prouision soeuer was laid vp in garners,
cellers and storehouses, for the kings necessarie vses, he caused the
same to be imploied towards the rel&eacute;efe of religious houses, and poore
people. He tooke of his subiects but sildome times any great tributes.
He was verie expert in feats of warre, and right fortunate therein. He
praised his capteins and men of warre when they were dead, and lamented
their losse more than he shewed to loue them when they were aliue. And
this did he of policie, that they might vnderstand that they should be
honoured after death, and therefore feare it the lesse. He was somwhat
learned, and also knowne to be wise.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Radulphus de Diceto.</i></span>
His care to haue iustice dulie ministred in his realme was exceeding
great, insomuch that finding how the shirifes were rather inclined to
seeke their owne gaine, than to deale vprightlie with his subiects, he
appointed other officers to haue a regard to their dooings, as if they
had b&eacute;ene controllers, that they knowing how there were such appointed
to haue a sound ouersight in their dealings, might be the more
circumspect in their duties. He ordeined also punishments for hunters in
forrests and grounds of warren, either by fining them, or by
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Moreouer, he ordeined that murtherers should suffer death by hanging:
and so for other transgressours he appointed other kinds of punishments,
as some to be condemned to exile, and other to losse of lims, &amp;c.:
according to the qualitie of the offense committed. And to haue the
lawes dulie executed, and iustice vprightlie ministred on all hands, he
was so carefull that he tried all orders of men, in placing them in
roomes of iustice. And lastlie, trusting to find among the cleargie such
as would not be corrupted with bribes, nor for respect of feare or
<span class="rightnote">Bishops chosen principall iustices.</span>
freendship decline from right iudgement, he chose foorth the bishops of
Winchester, Elie and Norwich to be principall iustices of the relme, so
as they might end and determine all matters, except in certeine cases
reserued to the hearing of the prince himselfe.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The vices of K. Henrie.</span>
His vices were these, as they are remembred. In time of aduerse fortune
no man could shew himselfe more courteous, gentle, m&eacute;eke, and promising
more largelie than he would. But when fortune once began to smile, no
man was more sharpe, hard to deale with, nor more redie to breake his
promise and faith. He was also partlie noted
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" ></a>
<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
of couetousnesse: for
although he was liberall towards souldiers and strangers, yet was he
streict inough towards his owne people, and namelie towards his sonnes,
which caused them to estrange themselues and their good wils from him.
He was not so zealous toward the execution of right and equitie as to
the furtherance of his owne priuat commoditie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">His incontinencie.</span>
He was out of measure giuen to fleshlie lust, and satisfieng of his
inordinate concupiscence. For not contented with the vse of his wife, he
kept manie concubines, but namelie he delited most in the companie of a
pleasant damsell, whom he called the Rose of the world (the common
people named hir Rosamund) for hir passing beautie, propernesse of
person, and pleasant wit, with other amiable qualities, being verelie a
<span class="rightnote">Rosamund his concubine.</span>
rare and p&eacute;erlesse p&eacute;ece in those daies. He made for hir an house at
Woodstocke in Oxfordshire, like a labyrinth, with such turnings and
windings in &amp; out as a knot in a garden called a maze, that no creature
might find hir nor come to hir, except he were instructed by the king,
or such as were secret with him in that matter. But the common report of
the people is, that the qu&eacute;ene in the end found hir out by a silken
thread, which the king had drawne after him out of hir chamber with his
foot, and dealt with hir in such sharpe and cruell wise, that she liued
not long after. She was buried in the nunrie of Goodstow beside Oxford,
with these verses vpon hir toome:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">H&icirc;c iacet in tumulo, Rosa mundi non Rosa munda,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non redolet sed olet, qu&aelig; redolere solet.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nogap">The meaning whereof may be found in Graftons large chronicle, page 77.
in an English septenarie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i></span>
Long time after the death of this damsell, in the said abbeie was shewed
a cofer, that sometimes was hirs, of the length of two foot, in the
which appeared giants fighting, startling of beasts, swimming of fishes,
and flieng of foules, so liuelie, that a man might woonder at the fine
deuise thereof.</p>

<p>Moreouer, king Henrie was noted not to be so fauourable to the liberties
&amp; fr&eacute;edoms of the church as he might haue b&eacute;ene. For besides the
persecuting of the foresaid Thomas archbishop of Canturburie, he would
not suffer the legats sent from the pope, to enter within the bounds of
his dominion, till they had sworne that they should doo nothing
preiudiciall to the customes of his kingdome, neither by prescribing
<span class="rightnote">His neglig&#275;ce in aiding the Christians against the
Saracens.</span>
orders, nor any other maner of act or meanes. He was thought to be
negligent in aiding the christian commonwealth in the holie land. For
though he had appointed twice or thrice to go thither in person, yet
being letted by light occasions, he staied at home, and sent small
rel&eacute;efe thither, though he was earnestlie called vpon for the same. His
estimation was such amongst forren princes, that Philip king of France
being newlie entred into the gouernement of that realme after his
fathers deceasse, committed<a name="FNanchor_5_14" id="FNanchor_5_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> himselfe and his kingdome to the disposition
and order of king Henrie, as if he had b&eacute;ene regent of his realme, and
gouernour of his person.</p>

<p>There liued in the daies of this king Henrie the second, diuerse
honourable personages and capteins of great fame, for their approued
valiancie and experience in warlike enterprises, as Robert earle of
Leicester, Hugh bigot earle of Northfolke, Reignold earle of Cornewall,
Robert Ferreis earle of Darbie, Richard Lacie, Roger Mowbray, Rafe de
Fulgiers, Humfrey Bohun conestable of England, Ranulfe Glandeuille,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Bale.</i></span>
William Vesey, &amp; Bernard de Ballioll. Also there flourished in his time
here in this land, men of singular learning in arts and sciences, as
Nicholas Breakespeare, Serlo surnamed Grammaticus, William Rheualensis,
Adam de Euesham, Thomas of Munmouth, Adelbertus Leuita, Geruasius
Cicestrensis, Odo Cantianus, Ealred Rhieuellensis, Johannes

<p>&para;&nbsp;Here may be thought that the reigne of the Normans and French men ouer
the realme of England tooke end, a hundred twentie two yeares after the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
